- He has also achieved the highest number of officially recognized maximum breaks in professional competition (15),

- the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship.

- O'Sullivan has refused to complete maximum breaks due to opinions on the maximum break prizes. In the 2016 Welsh Open, O'Sullivan intentionally played a pink ball and recorded a 146 break. It was suggested that O'Sullivan did this out of protest due to the maximum break prize being only £10,000, but he claimed it wasn't about the money and just wanted to have a little fun.
