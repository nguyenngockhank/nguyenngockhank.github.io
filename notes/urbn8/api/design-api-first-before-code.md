# Design API first before Code

Everyone **MUST** design the API first before commit yourselves to coding.

A development of an API **MUST** always start with API design without any upfront coding activities.

This applies for both new API and adjusting existing ones.

Junior developers **SHOULD** create a first proposal and discuss with the team.

Senior developers **MAY** create a first proposal and discuss with the team but is **RECOMMENDED** when there is uncertainty, and **REQUIRED** to do so if collaborator(s) requires the API contract upfront (for example, front-end coding happening in parallel with the API development).

**API design** (e.g., description, schema) **is the master of truth, not the API implementation.**
