Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to systems by disrupting traffic to a targeted server, service, or network.

While various techniques exist to combat DDoS attacks, understanding their strategy is vital for effective defense.

## How does a DDoS attack work?

DDoS attacks inundate a target with traffic from numerous sources, making it difficult to pinpoint and block the bad actors. The multi-source aspect sets DDoS apart from its cousin, the Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

There are different approaches to a DDoS attack, which vary depending on the system layer they are directed at. For example, they can target the application layer by making a large volume of application requests. Meanwhile, the protocol layer can be targeted by exploiting their function, for example, a SYN flood initiates a connection but never completes it leaving a large portion of connections half-open.

Recognizing the attack methods is an important first step to building a robust defense.

## Effective strategies to protect against DDoS attacks:

### ðŸ”· Embrace redundancy
Distributing network traffic across multiple servers, especially in varied geographical locations, makes it challenging for attackers to bring down your entire system. However, aimless redundancy can be a resource drain. The key is smart distribution that aligns with usage patterns and risk assessments.

### ðŸ”· Apply rate limiting
By restricting the number of requests a user can send in a given time frame, rate limiting can halt suspicious spikes in traffic. But be careful with this technique! Apply it too aggressively, and you risk alienating genuine users.

### ðŸ”· Implement WAFs
Use Web Application Firewalls to filter HTTP traffic and block harmful patterns, allowing only legitimate traffic.

### ðŸ”· Leverage cloud solutions
Cloud providers offer built-in solutions to help mitigate DDoS attacks, typically distributing traffic across their extensive networks and using advanced algorithms to preemptively identify and counteract threats.

### ðŸ”· Analyze traffic
Continuously monitor web traffic for anomalies. With real-time analysis, you can be proactive and act on threats while they're still in their early stages.

As DDoS attack methods evolve, organizations must continuously update their strategies and adopt new technologies. Cultivating cybersecurity awareness is key to staying prepared against these changing threats.
