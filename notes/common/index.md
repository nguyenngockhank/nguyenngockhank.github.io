## Architectural Styles vs. Architectural Patterns vs. Design Patterns

### Architectural Styles

::: tip Architectural Styles
Architectural styles tell us, in very broad strokes, how to organise our code. It’s the highest level of granularity and it specifies layers, high-level modules of the application and how those modules and layers interact with each other, the relations between them.

### Architectural Patterns

::: tip Architectural Patterns
A pattern is a recurring solution to a recurring problem. In the case of Architectural Patterns, they solve the problems related to the Architectural Style. For example, “what classes will we have and how will they interact, in order to implement a system with a specific set of layers“, or “what high-level modules will have in our Service-Oriented Architecture and how will they communicate“, or “how many tiers will our Client-server Architecture have“.
