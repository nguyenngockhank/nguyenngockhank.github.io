# Decentralized applications

## Overview

DApps, short for decentralized applications, are software applications that run on a decentralized computing system, typically a blockchain network.

- **Decentralized**: Unlike traditional apps that run on centralized servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network. This means they are not controlled by any single entity or individual.   
- **Blockchain-Based**: Most dApps leverage blockchain technology to store and process data, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.   
- **Smart Contracts**: Many dApps utilize smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with their terms directly written into lines of code. These contracts automate tasks and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries.   
- **Open-Source**: dApps are often open-source, meaning their code is publicly available, promoting transparency and community development.

### Examples:

- **Decentralized Finance** (DeFi): Lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoin protocols.  
- **Gaming**: Play-to-earn games, NFT marketplaces, and virtual worlds.   
- **Supply Chain Management**: Tracking goods, verifying authenticity, and managing logistics.   
- **Social Media**: Decentralized social media platforms that prioritize user privacy and data ownership.

### Characteristics:
- **Transparency**: All transactions and data are recorded on the blockchain, making them visible to anyone on the network.   
- **Censorship Resistance**: dApps are resistant to censorship as they operate on a decentralized network.
- Security: Blockchain technology enhances the security of dApps by making them tamper-proof and resistant to hacking.   
- **Autonomy**: dApps can operate autonomously, without the need for intermediaries or central authorities.
