# SDK Notes

## API Vs SDK!

API (Application Programming Interface) and SDK (Software Development Kit) are essential tools in the software development world, but they serve distinct purposes:

API:
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications and services to communicate with each other.

1. It defines how software components should interact.
2. Facilitates data exchange and functionality access between software components.
3. Typically consists of endpoints, requests, and responses.

SDK:
An SDK is a comprehensive package of tools, libraries, sample code, and documentation that assists developers in building applications for a particular platform, framework, or hardware.

1. Offers higher-level abstractions, simplifying development for a specific platform.
2. Tailored to specific platforms or frameworks, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance on that platform.
3. Offer access to advanced features and capabilities specific to the platform, which might be otherwise challenging to implement from scratch.

The choice between APIs and SDKs depends on the development goals and requirements of the project.

## Writing Code that Runs on All Platforms

Developing code that functions seamlessly across different platforms is a crucial skill for modern programmers. 

The need arises from the fact that users access software on a wide range of devices and operating systems. Achieving this universal compatibility can be complex due to differences in hardware, software environments, and user expectations.

Creating code that works on all platforms requires careful planning and understanding of the unique challenges presented by each platform.

Better planning and comprehension of cross-platform development not only streamline the process but also contribute to the long-term success of a software project. 

It reduces redundancy, simplifies maintenance, ensures consistency, boosting satisfaction and market reach.

Here are key factors for cross-platform compatibility
