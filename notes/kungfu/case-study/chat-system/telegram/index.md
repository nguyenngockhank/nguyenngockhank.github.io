# Telegram System Architecture

Telegram is one of the popular instant messaging applications that provides reliable communication services to millions of users worldwide. It was launched in 2013. It is a cloud-based messaging platform that offers end-to-end encryption for user communication. Telegram’s system architecture is designed to provide high performance, scalability, and reliability. It is a distributed system that consists of multiple components and services, including servers, data centers, and clients. The architecture is based on a client-server model, where clients communicate with servers to send and receive messages and other types of data.

## Key Differences Between the System Architectures of WhatsApp and Telegram

Feature | WhatsApp | Telegram
-------- | ---------| ------
Architecture | Centralized Arch | Decentralized Arch
Encryption Protocols | Signal Private Messenger Protocol | MTProto Protocol
Open API Availability | ❌ | ✅
Cloud Storage | user’s device & company’s servers | ✅
Active users | 2 billion  | 500 million

**Centralized vs. Decentralized Architecture** — WhatsApp is a centralized messaging application. Telegram is a decentralized architecture. WhatsApp stores all user data on the company’s servers to provide a seamless and consistent user experience. WhatsApp has complete control over user data. Telegram distributes user data across a network of servers located in different data centers around the world which provides increased security and privacy but leads to slower performance and inconsistency across different devices.

**Encryption Protocols** — WhatsApp uses the Signal Private Messenger Protocol for end-to-end encryption of user communication. It can provide strong security and privacy features, including message encryption, integrity, and authenticity. Also, it provides forward secrecy. Even if an attacker were to obtain the encryption key for a specific message, they would not be able to use that key to decrypt any previous or future messages sent between the same parties. Telegram uses its own MTProto Protocol for end-to-end encryption of user communication. It provides strong security and privacy features, including message encryption, integrity, and authenticity. It also provides the ability to send large files and the option to set messages to self-destruct after a certain period of time. It has been audited by third-party security experts and has been criticized for its lack of transparency.

**Open API Availability** — WhatsApp does not provide an open API and restricts the use of its platform to its client applications. Telegram provides an open API that allows developers to build custom applications and integrations with the Telegram platform such as building bots, games, and other interactive services.

**Cloud Storage** — WhatsApp does not provide cloud storage and stores user data only on the user’s device and the company’s servers. If the device is lost or damaged, the user may lose their data permanently, unless they have made a manual backup of their data. Telegram provides cloud storage for user data, including messages, photos, videos, and other files. It allows users to access their data from multiple devices with an internet connection and provides a backup in case the user’s device is lost or damaged. It allows users to selectively delete messages and data from the cloud, giving users greater control over their data privacy.

**User Base** — WhatsApp has over 2 billion active users worldwide. This large user base provides greater network effects for users. Telegram has over 500 million active users. This smaller user base provides greater privacy and security for its users.
