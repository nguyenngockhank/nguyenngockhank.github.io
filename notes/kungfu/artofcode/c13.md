**Writing Less Code**

Knowing when _not_ to code is possibly the most important skill a programmer can learn. Every

line of code you write is a line that has to be tested and maintained. By reusing libraries or

eliminating features, you can save time and keep your codebase lean and mean.

### Don’t Bother Implementing That Feature—You Won’t Need It

When you start a project, it’s natural to get excited and think of all the cool features you’ll

want to implement. But programmers tend to overestimate how many features are _truly_

_essential_ to their project. A lot of features go unfinished or unused or just complicate the

application.

Programmers also tend to underestimate how much effort it takes to implement a feature. We

optimistically estimate how long it will take to implement a crude prototype but forget how

much extra time is involved in future maintenance, documentation, and the added “weight”

to the codebase.

### Question and Break Down Your Requirements

Not all programs need to be fast, 100% correct, and able to handle every possible input. If you

really scrutinize your requirements, sometimes you can carve out a simpler problem that

requires less code. Let’s look at some examples of this.

**Example: A Store Locator**

Suppose you were writing a “store locator” for a business. You think your requirements are:

```
For any given user’s latitude/longitude, find the store with the closest latitude/longitude.
```
To implement this 100% correctly, you would need to handle:

- When the locations are on either side of the International Date Line
- When the locations are near the North or South Pole
- Adjusting for the curvature of the Earth, as “longitudinal degrees per mile” changes

Handling all of these cases requires a fair amount of code.

For your application, however, there are only 30 stores in the state of Texas. In this smaller

region, the three issues in the list aren’t that important. As a result, you can reduce your

requirements to:

```
For a user near Texas, find (approximately) the closest store in Texas.
```

Solving this problem is easier, as you can get away with just iterating through each store and

computing the Euclidean distance between the latitudes/longitudes.

**Example: Adding a Cache**

We once had a Java application that frequently read objects from disk. The speed of the

application was limited by these reads, so we wanted to implement caching of some sort. A

typical sequence of reads looked like this:

```
read Object A
read Object A
read Object A
read Object B
read Object B
read Object C
read Object D
read Object D
```
As you can see, there were a lot of repeated accesses to the same object, so caching should

definitely have helped.

When faced with this problem, our first instinct was to use a cache that discards the least

recently used items. We didn’t have one available in our library, so we would have had to

implement it ourselves. That wasn’t a problem though, as we’ve implemented such a data

structure before (it involves both a hash table and a singly linked list—perhaps 100 lines of

code in total).

However, we noticed that the repeated accesses were always in a row. So instead of

implementing an LRU cache, we just implemented a one-item cache:

```
DiskObject lastUsed; // class member
```
```
DiskObject lookUp(String key) {
if (lastUsed == null || !lastUsed.key().equals(key)) {
lastUsed = loadDiskObject(key);
}
```
```
return lastUsed;
}
```
This got us 90% of the benefit without much coding, and the program had a small memory

footprint, too.

The benefits of “removing requirements” and “solving simpler problems” can’t be overstated.

Requirements often interfere with each other in subtle ways. This means that solving half the

problem might only take a quarter as much coding effort.

### Keeping Your Codebase Small

When you first start a software project, and you have only one or two source files, things are

great. Compiling and running the code is a snap, it’s easy to make changes, and it’s easy to

remember where each function or class is defined.

Then, as the project grows, your directory fills up with more and more source files. Soon you

need multiple directories to organize them all. It’s harder to remember which functions call

which other functions, and tracking down bugs takes a little more work.

Eventually, you have lots of source code spread across many different directories. The project

is huge, and no single person understands it all. Adding new features becomes painful, and

working with the code is cumbersome and unpleasant.

What we’ve described is a natural law of the universe—as any coordinated system grows, the

complexity needed to keep it glued together grows even faster.

The best way to cope is to **keep your codebase as small and lightweight as possible** , even

as your project grows. Thus you should:

- Create as much generic “utility” code as possible to remove duplicated code. (See
    Chapter 10, _Extracting Unrelated Subproblems_ .)
- Remove unused code or useless features. (See the following sidebar.)
- Keep your project compartmentalized into disconnected subprojects.
- Generally, be conscious of the “weight” of your codebase. Keep it light and nimble.

REMOVING UNUSED CODE

```
Gardeners often prune plants to keep them alive and growing. Similarly, it’s a good idea to prune
any unused code that’s getting in the way.
```
```
Once code is written, coders are often reluctant to delete it, because it represents a lot of real work.
To delete it would mean admitting that the time spent on it was wasted. Well, get over it! This is a
creative field—photographers, writers, and filmmakers don’t keep all of their work, either.
```
```
Deleting isolated functions is easy, but sometimes “unused code” is actually woven throughout your
project, unbeknownst to you. Here are some examples:
```
- You originally designed your system to handle international filenames, and now the code is
    littered with conversion code. However, that code isn’t fully functional, and your app is never
    used with international filenames anyhow.

Why not remove this functionality?

- You wanted your program to work even if the system ran out of memory, so you have lots of
    clever logic that tries to recover from out-of-memory situations. It was a good idea, but in
    practice, when the system runs out of memory, your program just becomes an unstable zombie
    anyway—all the core features are unusable, and it’s one mouse click away from dying.

```
Why not just terminate the program with a simple “The system is out of memory, sorry” and
remove all this out-of-memory code?
```
### Be Familiar with the Libraries Around You

A lot of the time, programmers just aren’t aware that existing libraries can solve their problem.

Or sometimes they’ve forgotten what a library can do. It’s important to know the capabilities

of your library code so that you can make use of it.

Here’s a modest suggestion: **every once in a while, spend 15 minutes reading the names**

**of all the functions/modules/types in your standard library.** These include the C++

Standard Template Library (STL), the Java API, the built-in Python modules, and others.

The goal isn’t to memorize the whole library. It’s just to get a sense of what’s available, so that

next time you’re working on new code you’ll think, “Wait, this sounds similar to something I

saw in the API....” We believe doing this work upfront pays off quickly, as you’ll be more

inclined to use those libraries in the first place.

```

```

**Example: Lists and Sets in Python**

Suppose you have a list in Python (like [2,1,2]) and you want a list of the unique elements

(in this case, [2,1]). You could implement this task using a dictionary, which has a list of keys

that are guaranteed to be unique:

```
def unique(elements):
temp = {}
for element in elements:
temp[element] = None # The value doesn't matter.
return temp.keys()
```
```
unique_elements = unique([2,1,2])
```
But instead you can just use the lesser-known set type:

```
unique_elements = set ([2,1,2]) # Remove duplicates
```
This object is iterable, just like a normal list. If you really want a list object again, you can

just use:

```
unique_elements = list (set([2,1,2])) # Remove duplicates
```
Clearly, set is the right tool for the job here. But if you weren’t aware of the set type, you

might produce code like unique() above.

**Why Reusing Libraries Is Such a Win**

A commonly cited statistic is that the average software engineer produces ten shippable lines

of code a day. When programmers first hear this, they balk in disbelief—“Ten lines of code? I

can write that in a minute!”

The key word is _shippable_. Each line of code in a mature library represents a fair amount of

design, debugging, rewriting, documenting, optimizing, and testing. Any line of code that’s

survived this Darwinian process is very valuable. This is why reusing libraries is such a win, in

both saving time and having less code to write.

### Example: Using Unix Tools Instead of Coding

When a web server frequently returns 4xx or 5xx HTTP response codes, it’s a sign of a potential

problem (4xx being a client error; 5xx being a server error). So we wanted to write a program

that parses a web server’s access logs and determines which URLs are causing the most errors.

The access logs typically look something like this:

```
1.2.3.4 example.com [24/Aug/2010:01:08:34] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 ...
2.3.4.5 example.com [24/Aug/2010:01:14:27] "GET /help?topic=8 HTTP/1.1" 500 ...
3.4.5.6 example.com [24/Aug/2010:01:15:54] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 ...
...
```
Generally, they contain lines of this form:

**144** CHAPTER THIRTEEN


```
browser-IP host [date] "GET /url-path HTTP/1.1" HTTP-response-code ...
```
Writing a program to find the most common url-paths with 4xx or 5xx response codes might

easily take 20 lines of code in a language like C++ or Java.

Instead, in Unix, you can type this command line:

```
cat access.log | awk '{ print $5 " " $7 }' | egrep "[45]..$" \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```
which produces output like this:

```
95 /favicon.ico 404
13 /help?topic=8 500
11 /login 403
```
```
<count> <path> <http response code>
```
What’s great about this command line is that we’ve avoided writing any “real” code or checking

anything into source control.

### Summary

```
Adventure, excitement—a Jedi craves not these things.
```
```
—Yoda
```
This chapter is about writing as little new code as possible. Each new line of code needs to be

tested, documented, and maintained. Further, the more code in your codebase, the “heavier”

it gets and the harder it is to develop in.

You can avoid writing new lines of code by:

- Eliminating nonessential features from your product and not overengineering
- Rethinking requirements to solve the easiest version of the problem that still gets the job
    done
- Staying familiar with standard libraries by periodically reading through their entire APIs
