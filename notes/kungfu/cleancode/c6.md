# 6. Objects and Data Structures

There is a reason that we keep our variables private. We don’t want anyone else to depend
on them. We want to keep the freedom to change their type or implementation on a whim
or an impulse. Why, then, do so many programmers automatically add getters and setters
to their objects, exposing their private variables as if they were public?

## Data Abstraction ..

Consider the difference between Listing 6-1 and Listing 6-2. Both represent the data of a
point on the Cartesian plane. And yet one exposes its implementation and the other com-
pletely hides it.


94 **Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures**

The beautiful thing about Listing 6-2 is that there is no way you can tell whether the
implementation is in rectangular or polar coordinates. It might be neither! And yet the
interface still unmistakably represents a data structure.

But it represents more than just a data structure. The methods enforce an access
policy. You can read the individual coordinates independently, but you must set the coordi-
nates together as an atomic operation.

Listing 6-1, on the other hand, is very clearly implemented in rectangular coordinates,
and it forces us to manipulate those coordinates independently. This exposes implementa-
tion. Indeed, it would expose implementation even if the variables were private and we
were using single variable getters and setters.

Hiding implementation is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between
the variables. Hiding implementation is about abstractions! A class does not simply
push its variables out through getters and setters. Rather it exposes abstract interfaces
that allow its users to manipulate the _essence_ of the data, without having to know its
implementation.

Consider Listing 6-3 and Listing 6-4. The first uses concrete terms to communicate
the fuel level of a vehicle, whereas the second does so with the abstraction of percentage.
In the concrete case you can be pretty sure that these are just accessors of variables. In the
abstract case you have no clue at all about the form of the data.

```
Listing 6-1
Concrete Point
public class Point {
public double x;
public double y;
}
```
```
Listing 6-2
Abstract Point
public interface Point {
double getX();
double getY();
void setCartesian(double x, double y);
double getR();
double getTheta();
void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
```
```
Listing 6-3
Concrete Vehicle
public interface Vehicle {
double getFuelTankCapacityInGallons();
double getGallonsOfGasoline();
}
```

**Data/Object Anti-Symmetry** 95

In both of the above cases the second option is preferable. We do not want to expose
the details of our data. Rather we want to express our data in abstract terms. This is not
merely accomplished by using interfaces and/or getters and setters. Serious thought needs
to be put into the best way to represent the data that an object contains. The worst option is
to blithely add getters and setters.

## Data/Object Anti-Symmetry ..

These two examples show the difference between objects and data structures. Objects hide
their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data struc-
ture expose their data and have no meaningful functions. Go back and read that again.
Notice the complimentary nature of the two definitions. They are virtual opposites. This
difference may seem trivial, but it has far-reaching implications.

Consider, for example, the procedural shape example in Listing 6-5. The Geometry
class operates on the three shape classes. The shape classes are simple data structures
without any behavior. All the behavior is in the Geometry class.

```
Listing 6-4
Abstract Vehicle
public interface Vehicle {
double getPercentFuelRemaining();
}
```
```
Listing 6-5
Procedural Shape
public class Square {
public Point topLeft;
public double side;
}
public class Rectangle {
public Point topLeft;
public double height;
public double width;
}
public class Circle {
public Point center;
public double radius;
}
public class Geometry {
public final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
```
```
public double area(Object shape) throws NoSuchShapeException
{
if (shape instanceof Square) {
Square s = (Square)shape;
return s.side * s.side;
}
```

96 **Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures**

Object-oriented programmers might wrinkle their noses at this and complain that it
is procedural—and they’d be right. But the sneer may not be warranted. Consider what
would happen if a perimeter() function were added to Geometry. The shape classes would
be unaffected! Any other classes that depended upon the shapes would also be unaffected!
On the other hand, if I add a new shape, I must change all the functions in Geometryto
deal with it. Again, read that over. Notice that the two conditions are diametrically
opposed.

Now consider the object-oriented solution in Listing 6-6. Here the area()method is
polymorphic. No Geometry class is necessary. So if I add a new shape, none of the existing
_functions_ are affected, but if I add a new function all of the _shapes_ must be changed!^1

```
else if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
Rectangle r = (Rectangle)shape;
return r.height * r.width;
}
else if (shape instanceof Circle) {
Circle c = (Circle)shape;
return PI * c.radius * c.radius;
}
throw new NoSuchShapeException();
}
}
```
```
Listing 6-6
Polymorphic Shapes
public class Square implements Shape {
private Point topLeft;
private double side;
public double area() {
return side*side;
}
}
public class Rectangle implements Shape {
private Point topLeft;
private double height;
private double width;
public double area() {
return height * width;
}
}
```
1. There are ways around this that are well known to experienced object-oriented designers: VISITOR, or dual-dispatch, for
    example. But these techniques carry costs of their own and generally return the structure to that of a procedural program.

**The Law of Demeter** 97

Again, we see the complimentary nature of these two definitions; they are virtual
opposites! This exposes the fundamental dichotomy between objects and data structures:

```
Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without
changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add
new classes without changing existing functions.
```
```
The complement is also true:
Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must
change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.
```
So, the things that are hard for OO are easy for procedures, and the things that are
hard for procedures are easy for OO!

In any complex system there are going to be times when we want to add new data
types rather than new functions. For these cases objects and OO are most appropriate. On
the other hand, there will also be times when we’ll want to add new functions as opposed
to data types. In that case procedural code and data structures will be more appropriate.

Mature programmers know that the idea that everything is an object _is a myth_. Some-
times you really _do_ want simple data structures with procedures operating on them.

## The Law of Demeter 

There is a well-known heuristic called the _Law of Demeter_^2 that says a module should not
know about the innards of the _objects_ it manipulates. As we saw in the last section, objects
hide their data and expose operations. This means that an object should not expose its
internal structure through accessors because to do so is to expose, rather than to hide, its
internal structure.

More precisely, the Law of Demeter says that a method _f_ of a class _C_ should only call
the methods of these:

```
•C
```
- An object created by _f_

```
public class Circle implements Shape {
private Point center;
private double radius;
public final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
public double area() {
return PI * radius * radius;
}
}
```
2. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)

```
Listing 6-6 (continued)
Polymorphic Shapes
```

98 **Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures**

- An object passed as an argument to _f_
- An object held in an instance variable of _C_

The method should _not_ invoke methods on objects that are returned by any of the
allowed functions. In other words, talk to friends, not to strangers.

The following code^3 appears to violate the Law of Demeter (among other things)
because it calls the getScratchDir()function on the return value of getOptions()and then
callsgetAbsolutePath() on the return value of getScratchDir().

```
final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();
```
### Train Wrecks 

This kind of code is often called a _train wreck_ because it look like a bunch of coupled train
cars. Chains of calls like this are generally considered to be sloppy style and should be
avoided [G36]. It is usually best to split them up as follows:

Options opts = ctxt.getOptions();
File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();
final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();
Are these two snippets of code viola-
tions of the Law of Demeter? Certainly
the containing module knows that the
ctxtobject contains options, which con-
tain a scratch directory, which has an
absolute path. That’s a lot of knowledge
for one function to know. The calling
function knows how to navigate through
a lot of different objects.

Whether this is a violation of Demeter depends on whether or not ctxt,Options, and
ScratchDirare objects or data structures. If they are objects, then their internal structure
should be hidden rather than exposed, and so knowledge of their innards is a clear viola-
tion of the Law of Demeter. On the other hand, if ctxt,Options, and ScratchDirare just
data structures with no behavior, then they naturally expose their internal structure, and so
Demeter does not apply.

The use of accessor functions confuses the issue. If the code had been written as fol-
lows, then we probably wouldn’t be asking about Demeter violations.

final String outputDir = ctxt.options.scratchDir.absolutePath;
This issue would be a lot less confusing if data structures simply had public variables
and no functions, whereas objects had private variables and public functions. However,

**The Law of Demeter** 99

there are frameworks and standards (e.g., “beans”) that demand that even simple data
structures have accessors and mutators.

### Hybrids .

This confusion sometimes leads to unfortunate hybrid structures that are half object and
half data structure. They have functions that do significant things, and they also have either
public variables or public accessors and mutators that, for all intents and purposes, make
the private variables public, tempting other external functions to use those variables the
way a procedural program would use a data structure.^4

Such hybrids make it hard to add new functions but also make it hard to add new data
structures. They are the worst of both worlds. Avoid creating them. They are indicative of a
muddled design whose authors are unsure of—or worse, ignorant of—whether they need
protection from functions or types.

### Hiding Structure ...

What if ctxt,options, and scratchDirare objects with real behavior? Then, because
objects are supposed to hide their internal structure, we should not be able to navigate
through them. How then would we get the absolute path of the scratch directory?

```
ctxt.getAbsolutePathOfScratchDirectoryOption();
```
or

```
ctx.getScratchDirectoryOption().getAbsolutePath()
```
The first option could lead to an explosion of methods in the ctxt object. The second pre-
sumes that getScratchDirectoryOption()returns a data structure, not an object. Neither
option feels good.

Ifctxtis an object, we should be telling it to _do something;_ we should not be asking it
about its internals. So why did we want the absolute path of the scratch directory? What
were we going to do with it? Consider this code from (many lines farther down in) the
same module:

String outFile = outputDir + "/" + className.replace('.', '/') + ".class";
FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(outFile);
BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fout);
The admixture of different levels of detail [G34][G6] is a bit troubling. Dots, slashes,
file extensions, and Fileobjects should not be so carelessly mixed together, and mixed
with the enclosing code. Ignoring that, however, we see that the intent of getting the abso-
lute path of the scratch directory was to create a scratch file of a given name.

4. This is sometimes called Feature Envy from [Refactoring].


100 **Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures**

So, what if we told the ctxt object to do this?
BufferedOutputStream bos = ctxt.createScratchFileStream(classFileName);
That seems like a reasonable thing for an object to do! This allows ctxtto hide its
internals and prevents the current function from having to violate the Law of Demeter by
navigating through objects it shouldn’t know about.

## Data Transfer Objects ...

The quintessential form of a data structure is a class with public variables and no func-
tions. This is sometimes called a data transfer object, or DTO. DTOs are very useful struc-
tures, especially when communicating with databases or parsing messages from sockets,
and so on. They often become the first in a series of translation stages that convert raw data
in a database into objects in the application code.

Somewhat more common is the “bean” form shown in Listing 6-7. Beans have private
variables manipulated by getters and setters. The quasi-encapsulation of beans seems to
make some OO purists feel better but usually provides no other benefit.

```
Listing 6-7
address.java
public class Address {
private String street;
private String streetExtra;
private String city;
private String state;
private String zip;
public Address(String street, String streetExtra,
String city, String state, String zip) {
this.street = street;
this.streetExtra = streetExtra;
this.city = city;
this.state = state;
this.zip = zip;
}
public String getStreet() {
return street;
}
public String getStreetExtra() {
return streetExtra;
}
public String getCity() {
return city;
}
```

### Active Record .

Active Records are special forms of DTOs. They are data structures with public (or bean-
accessed) variables; but they typically have navigational methods like save and find. Typi-
cally these Active Records are direct translations from database tables, or other data
sources.

Unfortunately we often find that developers try to treat these data structures as though
they were objects by putting business rule methods in them. This is awkward because it
creates a hybrid between a data structure and an object.

The solution, of course, is to treat the Active Record as a data structure and to create
separate objects that contain the business rules and that hide their internal data (which are
probably just instances of the Active Record).

## Conclusion ..

Objects expose behavior and hide data. This makes it easy to add new kinds of objects
without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add new behaviors to existing
objects. Data structures expose data and have no significant behavior. This makes it easy to
add new behaviors to existing data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures
to existing functions.

In any given system we will sometimes want the flexibility to add new data types, and
so we prefer objects for that part of the system. Other times we will want the flexibility to
add new behaviors, and so in that part of the system we prefer data types and procedures.
Good software developers understand these issues without prejudice and choose the
approach that is best for the job at hand.
