# Comparision

## SQL vs. NoSQL
|    | SQL | NoSQL |
| ---------- | -----|--------|
| Difinition | Relational Databases | non-relational or distributed database. |
| Type | table based | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| Schema | predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Scale | vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| Data | uses SQL for defining and manipulating | queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes called as UnQL|
| For complex query  | good fit for the complex query | donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries |
| type of data to be stored |  not best fit for hierarchical data storage | fits better |
| For high transactional | For high transactional based application | not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications |
| For properties |  emphasizes on ACID | follows the Brewers CAP theorem|

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language
- **UnQL**: Unstructured Query Language
- **ACID**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability
- **CAP**: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance
