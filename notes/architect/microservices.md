# Microservices

## Integration

**Shared Database**

- The consumer is tied to a specific technology of the service. Good bye, loose coupling.
- If the service makes change that can update & deploy into many consumers. Bye, cohesion.

**Sync vs Async Communication**


### Orchestration vs Choreography

- **With Orchestration**: we rely on a central brain to guide & drive the process. like the conductor in an orchestra.
- **With Choreography:** we inform each part of the system of its job, and let it work out the details, like dancers all finding their way and reacting to others around them in a ballet.
