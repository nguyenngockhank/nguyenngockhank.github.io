## Theorem

### CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem, also known as **Brewer's Theorem**, is a fundamental principle in distributed computing that states:

> In a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

### PACELC Theorem

The PACELC theorem expands on the CAP theorem and states: 

> In distributed computer systems, you have to make tradeoffs between consistency and availability in the presence of network partitions, and between consistency and latency in the absence of network partitions.

Feature | CAP Theorem	| PACELC Theorem
------ | --------------- | ----------
Focus	|  Network partitions | 	Both partitions and non-partitioned scenarios
Guarantees	|  Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance	|  Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance, Latency
Trade-offs in Partitioned Scenarios | 	Consistency vs. Availability	|  Consistency vs. Availability
Trade-offs in Non-Partitioned Scenarios	|  N/A	|  Latency vs. Consistency
Best Use Cases	|  Systems that prioritize consistency or availability in the face of partitions | 	Systems that need to balance consistency, availability, and latency in all scenarios
