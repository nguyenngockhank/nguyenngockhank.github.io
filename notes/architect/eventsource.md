# Event Sourcing 

## Overview

Event sourcing is a software design pattern that focuses on capturing and storing the changes made to an application's state as a sequence of events. Instead of persisting the current state of an object, event sourcing stores the series of events that led to the current state. These events are immutable and can be replayed to reconstruct the state of the application at any point in time.

In event sourcing, events are the primary source of truth. They represent meaningful actions or occurrences within the system. Each event is stored in an event log or event store, which serves as a historical record of all the events that have occurred. This log can be used to rebuild the state of the application by replaying the events in the same order they were originally recorded.

By using event sourcing, developers can achieve several benefits. One of the key advantages is the ability to have a complete audit trail of all changes made to the system. Since events are **immutable** and stored in a log, it becomes easier to track and analyze the history of the application. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where compliance or regulatory requirements are important.

Another benefit of event sourcing is the ability to derive different views or projections of the application's state. By replaying the events, developers can create different representations of the data, tailored to specific use cases or requirements. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in the system.

Event sourcing also enables **temporal queries**, as developers can query the event log for specific points in time or ranges of time. This can be useful for debugging, troubleshooting, or analyzing the behavior of the system at different points in its history.

To implement event sourcing, developers typically use an event sourcing framework or library that provides the necessary infrastructure for event storage, retrieval, and replay. These frameworks often include features such as event serialization, event handlers, and event replay mechanisms.

## Terms

**Event**: An event represents a specific occurrence or action that has happened in the system. It encapsulates all the relevant information about the event, such as the event type, timestamp, and any additional data associated with the event. Events are immutable and should not be modified once they are created.

**Aggregate**: An aggregate is a domain object or a group of domain objects that are treated as a single unit within the event sourcing pattern. Aggregates are responsible for handling commands and generating events based on the business logic. They encapsulate the state and behavior of the domain objects they represent.

**Command**: A command is a request or an action that is sent to an aggregate to perform a specific operation. Commands are typically initiated by external systems or user interactions. When a command is received, the aggregate processes it and generates one or more events as a result.

**Event Store**: The event store is a persistent storage mechanism that stores all the events generated by the aggregates. It provides an append-only log of events, allowing the system to reconstruct the application's state by replaying the events in the correct order. The event store should be designed to handle high write throughput and provide efficient querying capabilities.

**Projection**: A projection is a read model that represents a specific view of the application's state. Projections are created by subscribing to the events in the event store and updating the read model accordingly. They are optimized for querying and provide a denormalized view of the data to support efficient read operations.

**Snapshot**: A snapshot is a point-in-time representation of an aggregate's state. It is used to optimize the process of reconstructing an aggregate's state by reducing the number of events that need to be replayed. Snapshots are periodically taken and stored in the event store alongside the events.

## Projection vs Snapshot

### Projection
A projection in event sourcing refers to the process of transforming a stream of events into a read model that can be queried for specific information. It is essentially a way to create a denormalized view of the events that have occurred in the system.

Projections are typically used to generate views or reports that provide a specific perspective on the data. They can be used to answer questions like "What is the current state of a particular entity?" or "What are the total sales for a specific product?"

Projections are usually implemented as separate components or services that subscribe to the event stream and update their internal state accordingly. They can be updated in real-time or periodically, depending on the requirements of the system.

### Snapshot
A snapshot, on the other hand, is a mechanism used to optimize the performance of event sourcing systems. It involves taking a snapshot of the current state of an aggregate or entity and storing it separately from the event stream.

The purpose of a snapshot is to reduce the amount of events that need to be replayed when reconstructing the state of an aggregate. Instead of replaying all the events from the beginning of time, the system can start from the latest snapshot and then apply only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken.

Snapshots are typically taken at regular intervals or when a certain threshold is reached (e.g., number of events or elapsed time). They can be stored in a separate database or alongside the event stream, depending on the implementation.

By using snapshots, the system can significantly reduce the time and resources required to rebuild the state of an aggregate, especially when dealing with large event streams.


## How to build

### 1. Custom Implementation
One way to build event sourcing is to implement it from scratch using your preferred programming language and database. This approach gives you complete control over the implementation and allows you to tailor it to your specific requirements. You can use a database to store the events and design your own event store and event sourcing infrastructure. While this approach provides flexibility, it requires a deep understanding of event sourcing concepts and can be time-consuming to develop and maintain.

### 2. Event Sourcing Frameworks
Another option is to use event sourcing frameworks that provide a set of tools and libraries to simplify the implementation of event sourcing. These frameworks often come with built-in support for event storage, event replay, and event handling. Some popular event sourcing frameworks include `Axon Framework` (Java), `EventStore` (C#), and `Eventuate` (Java and Scala). These frameworks abstract away the complexities of event sourcing, allowing you to focus on implementing the business logic of your application.

### 3. Cloud-based Event Sourcing Services
If you prefer a managed solution, you can consider using cloud-based event sourcing services. These services provide a fully managed infrastructure for event sourcing, allowing you to focus on developing your application without worrying about infrastructure management. Examples of cloud-based event sourcing services include `AWS EventBridge`, `Azure Event Grid`, and `Google Cloud Pub/Sub`. These services offer scalability, reliability, and ease of use, but they may come with additional costs and dependencies on the cloud provider.

### 4. Event Sourcing Databases
There are also specialized databases designed specifically for event sourcing. These databases provide built-in support for storing and querying events, making it easier to implement event sourcing. Examples of event sourcing databases include `EventStoreDB`, `Apache Kafka`, and `Apache Pulsar`. These databases often offer features like event streaming, event replay, and event-driven architectures, making them a popular choice for event sourcing implementations.

### 5. Hybrid Approaches
Lastly, you can also consider hybrid approaches that combine event sourcing with other architectural patterns. For example, you can use a combination of event sourcing and command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) to separate the write and read models of your application. This allows you to optimize the read and write operations independently, improving performance and scalability. Frameworks like Axon Framework and Lagom provide support for both event sourcing and CQRS, making it easier to implement hybrid architectures.

## Common Problems

### Complexity
Event sourcing introduces additional complexity to the system architecture. Instead of storing the current state of an entity, event sourcing requires storing a sequence of events that represent changes to the entity's state over time. This can make the system more difficult to understand, implement, and maintain, especially for developers who are not familiar with event sourcing.

### Event Schema Evolution
As the system evolves, the structure and semantics of events may change. This can lead to challenges when dealing with event schema evolution. For example, if a new field needs to be added to an event, existing events may need to be migrated or transformed to accommodate the change. Managing event schema evolution can be complex and requires careful planning and coordination.

### Event Replay
Event replay is a common technique used in event sourcing to rebuild the state of an entity by replaying the events that have occurred. However, event replay can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for systems with a large number of events. It is important to optimize the event replay process to ensure efficient and timely system recovery.

### Event Ordering and Consistency
Maintaining event ordering and consistency can be challenging in distributed systems. Events may be generated and processed concurrently, leading to potential conflicts and inconsistencies. Ensuring that events are processed in the correct order and that the system remains consistent can require careful coordination and synchronization mechanisms.

### Performance and Scalability
Event sourcing can have performance and scalability implications. Storing and processing a large number of events can put a strain on system resources and impact performance. It is important to design the system in a way that can handle the expected event load and scale as needed.

###  Debugging and Testing
Debugging and testing event-sourced systems can be more challenging compared to traditional systems. Since the current state of an entity is not directly stored, it may be more difficult to inspect and debug issues. Additionally, testing the system's behavior and ensuring correctness can require specialized testing techniques and tools.

## Best Practices

Event sourcing is a powerful technique for building scalable and resilient systems. It allows you to capture and store every change made to an application's state as a series of events. These events can then be replayed to reconstruct the state of the application at any point in time. However, to ensure the success of an event sourcing implementation, it is important to follow certain best practices. In this article, we will discuss some of these best practices.

### 1. Design Events as Immutable Data

When designing events, it is crucial to treat them as immutable data. Once an event is created, it should not be modified. This ensures that the historical record of events remains intact and can be relied upon for auditing, debugging, and replaying purposes. By making events immutable, you also avoid any unintended side effects that could occur if events were mutable.

### 2. Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles
Event sourcing works best when combined with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. DDD helps in modeling the domain and defining the boundaries of aggregates, which are the consistency boundaries within which events are applied. By following DDD principles, you can ensure that your events accurately represent the business domain and capture the intent of the changes being made.

### 3. Version Events and Handle Evolution
As your application evolves, the structure of events may change. It is important to version your events and handle their evolution gracefully. This can be done by introducing new event types and providing backward compatibility for older versions. By versioning events, you can ensure that the historical events can still be replayed correctly, even when the structure of events has changed.

### 4. Use Eventual Consistency
Event sourcing promotes eventual consistency, where changes to the application state are propagated asynchronously through events. This means that the state of the application may not be immediately updated after a command is executed. It is important to design your system to handle eventual consistency and ensure that users are aware of any delays in state updates.

### 5. Implement Event Replay and Projection
One of the key benefits of event sourcing is the ability to replay events to reconstruct the state of the application. Implementing event replay and projection mechanisms allows you to rebuild the state of the application from scratch or at specific points in time. This can be useful for debugging, auditing, or generating reports.

### 6. Ensure Data Integrity and Security
Since events are the source of truth in an event sourcing system, it is important to ensure their integrity and security. Use techniques like event hashing and digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of events. Implement access controls and encryption to protect sensitive event data.

### 7. Monitor and Measure Performance
Event sourcing can introduce additional complexity and overhead compared to traditional data storage approaches. It is important to monitor and measure the performance of your event sourcing system to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. Use tools and techniques like event sourcing frameworks, distributed tracing, and performance testing to ensure the system meets the required performance criteria.
