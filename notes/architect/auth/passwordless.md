# Passwordless Auth

When it comes to authentication, there are three factors to consider:

- Knowledge factors: something you know, such as a password
- Ownership factors: something you own, such as a device or phone number
- Inherence factors: something unique to you, such as your biometric features

![Factors](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/58/1d/fe581d69d975741fa73abf1eb3e29b88.jpg)

Passwords fall under “something you know”. One-Time Passwords (OTP) prove that the user owns a cell phone or a device, while biometric authentication proves "something unique to you".

## One-Time Passwords (OTP)
One-Time Passwords (OTP) are widely used as a more secure method of authentication. Unlike static passwords, which can be reused, OTPs are valid for a limited time, typically a few minutes. This means that even if someone intercepts an OTP, they can’t use it to log in later. Additionally, OTPs require “something you own” as well as “something you know” to log in. This can be a cell phone number or email address that the user has access to, making it harder for hackers to steal.

However, it's important to note that using SMS as the delivery method for OTPs can be less secure than other methods. This is because SMS messages can be intercepted or redirected by hackers, particularly if the user's phone number has been compromised. In some cases, attackers have been able to hijack phone numbers by convincing the mobile carrier to transfer the number to a new SIM card. Once the attacker has control of the number, they can intercept any OTPs sent via SMS. For this reason, it's recommended to use alternative delivery methods, such as email or mobile apps, whenever possible.

Here’s how OTPs work in more detail:

- Step 1: The user wants to log in to a website and is asked to enter a username, cell phone number, or email.
- Step 2: The server generates an OTP with an expiration time.
- Step 3: The server sends the OTP to the user’s device via SMS or email.
- Step 4: The user enters the OTP received in the login box.
- Step 5-6: The server compares the generated OTP with the one the user entered. If they match, login is granted.

Alternatively, a hardware or software key can be used to generate OTPs for multi-factor authentication (MFA). For example, Google 2FA uses a software key that generates a new OTP every 30 seconds. When logging in, users enter their password and the current OTP displayed on their device. This adds an extra layer of security as hackers would need access to the user’s device to steal the OTP. More on MFA later.


## Passkeys: A Password-Free Future

A passkey is a digital credential that replaces traditional passwords. It's a more secure and convenient way to log in to websites and apps.

### How it works:

**Creation**
- The end-user needs to confirm the account information and present their credentials (face ID, touch ID, etc.).
- A private key is generated based on the public key provided by the website. The private key is stored on the device.

**Authentication**
- When the user tries to sign in to a website, they use the generated private key. Just select the account information and present the credentials to unlock the private key.
- Consequently, there is no risk of password leakage since no passwords are stored in the websites' databases.

**Implementation**
- Library: [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/packages/server)
- Project example [repo](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn)
    - [server file](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/blob/master/example/index.ts)
    - [client file](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/blob/master/example/public/index.html)



## OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)

While OAuth 2.0 is primarily an authorization framework, it can be used in conjunction with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication purposes. OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, enabling the verification of a user's identity and granting controlled access to protected resources.

When using "Sign in with Google" or similar features, OAuth 2.0 and OIDC work together to streamline the authentication process. OIDC provides user identity data in the form of a standardized JSON Web Token (JWT). This token contains information about the authenticated user, allowing the third-party application to create a user profile without requiring a separate registration process.

In this setup, OAuth 2.0 provides "secure delegated access" by issuing short-lived tokens instead of passwords, allowing third-party services to access protected resources with the resource owner's permission. This method enhances security, as the third-party service does not handle or store the user's password directly.

The diagram below shows how the protocol works in the “Sign in with Google” scenario.

In the “Sign in with Google” example, OAuth 2.0 defines four roles:

- **Resource owner**: The end user, who controls access to their personal data.
- **Resource server**: The Google server hosting user profiles as protected resources. It uses access tokens to respond to protected resource requests, ensuring that only authorized services can access the data.
- **Client**: The device (PC or smartphone) making requests on behalf of the resource owner. This device represents the third-party application seeking access to the user's data.
- **Authorization server:** The Google authorization server that issues tokens to clients, managing the secure exchange of tokens between the resource server and the client.

OAuth 2.0 offers four types of authorization grants to accommodate different situations:

- **Authorization code grant**: The most complete and versatile mode, suitable for most application types. More details below.
- **Implicit grant**: Designed for applications with only a frontend, such as single-page applications or mobile apps. This is no longer recommended. More details below.
- **Resource owner password credentials grant**: Used when users trust a third-party application with their credentials, such as a trusted mobile app.
- **Client credentials grant**: Suitable for cases without a frontend, like command-line tools or server-to-server communication, where resource owner interaction is not needed.

The standard provides multiple modes to cater to different application scenarios and requirements, ensuring flexibility and adaptability for diverse situations.

The authorization code grant is one example worth examining. The specifications for the other three grant types are available in RFC-6749.
