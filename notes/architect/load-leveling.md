# Load Leveling 

The Load Leveling is a resilience pattern commonly used in microservices architecture to manage and distribute the load evenly across multiple services. It helps to prevent overloading of individual services and ensures the overall system remains stable and responsive even during peak loads.

In a microservices architecture, different services handle specific tasks or functionalities. Each service may have different processing capabilities and resource capacities. During periods of high traffic or increased demand, certain services may become overwhelmed, leading to performance degradation or even service failures.

The Load Leveling addresses this issue by distributing the incoming load across multiple instances of the same service or different services. It aims to balance the workload and prevent any single service from being overloaded.


## Strategies

There are several techniques and strategies that can be employed to implement the Load Leveling:

**Load Balancing**: Load balancers are used to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a service. They can be configured to use various algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, or weighted distribution, to evenly distribute the load. Load balancers monitor the health and availability of each service instance and route requests accordingly.

**Horizontal Scaling**: By adding more instances of a service, the overall capacity and processing power can be increased. This allows the system to handle a higher load and distribute it across multiple instances. Horizontal scaling can be achieved by deploying additional instances of the same service or by introducing new services to handle specific tasks.

**Circuit Breaker**: A circuit breaker is a mechanism that monitors the health and availability of a service. If a service becomes overloaded or unresponsive, the circuit breaker can temporarily stop sending requests to that service and redirect them to an alternative service or display an error message. This helps to prevent cascading failures and allows the system to recover from failures more quickly.

**Queueing**: By introducing a message queue between services, the load can be leveled by decoupling the rate at which requests are received from the rate at which they are processed. Services can consume messages from the queue at their own pace, allowing them to handle the load more efficiently. This also provides a buffer for handling bursts of traffic and prevents overload on individual services.

Implementing the Load Leveling requires careful consideration of the system's architecture, scalability requirements, and the characteristics of individual services. It is important to monitor the system's performance and adjust the load balancing strategies as needed to ensure optimal resource utilization and responsiveness.

## Example

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient;

    @GetMapping("/my-service")
    public ResponseEntity<String> myService() {
        ServiceInstance serviceInstance = loadBalancerClient.choose("my-service");
        URI uri = serviceInstance.getUri();
        // Make a request to the chosen service instance
        // ...
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Response from my-service");
    }
}
```

In the above example, the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is used to choose a service instance for handling the request. The load balancer automatically distributes the load across available instances of the "my-service" service.

By implementing the Load Leveling pattern, microservices can handle varying loads more effectively, ensuring the system remains resilient and responsive even under high demand.
