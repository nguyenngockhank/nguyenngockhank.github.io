# Managing application logic

## Domain Model Pattern

**Core Idea**: Represents real-world entities and their relationships as objects in the application.

**Benefits**:
- Encapsulates business logic within objects, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- Provides a natural mapping to the problem domain, improving understanding.
- Supports complex object-oriented interactions.

**Drawbacks**:
- Can be more complex to implement, especially for large-scale applications.
- May require additional infrastructure, such as object-relational mappers (ORMs).

**Use Cases**:
- Applications with rich domain logic and complex relationships between entities.
- When a high degree of object-oriented modeling is desired.

## Table Module Pattern

**Core Idea**: Organizes code around database tables, with each module responsible for operations on a specific table.

**Benefits**:
- Simple and straightforward to implement.
- Often aligns well with the relational database schema.
- Can be effective for smaller applications or when the domain logic is relatively simple.

**Drawbacks**:
- Can lead to tightly coupled code and reduced reusability.
- May not effectively model complex business rules.

**Use Cases**:
- Smaller applications with a simpler domain.
- When performance is a critical concern and database access is optimized.

## Transaction Script Pattern

**Core Idea**:
- Represents a transaction as a single unit of work, encapsulating the logic and data access required to complete the transaction.

**Benefits:**
- Easy to understand and implement.
- Can be effective for simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Provides a clear separation of concerns between presentation and data access.

**Drawbacks**:
- Can lead to duplication of code for similar transactions.
- May not be suitable for complex business logic or large-scale applications.

**Use Cases**:
- Small to medium-sized applications with relatively simple business rules.
- When performance is a critical concern and transaction boundaries are well-defined.
