# Graceful Degradation Pattern


The Graceful Degradation pattern is a design approach used in applications to handle failures and ensure the system remains functional even when certain components or services are unavailable or experiencing issues. It focuses on gracefully handling errors and degrading the system's functionality in a controlled manner, rather than completely failing or crashing.

In a microservices architecture, where different services communicate with each other, it is crucial to handle failures effectively to maintain the overall system's stability. The Graceful Degradation pattern helps achieve this by allowing the system to continue functioning, albeit with reduced capabilities, when a service or component becomes unavailable.

## Key principles and techniques

**Error Handling**: Proper error handling is essential to gracefully degrade the system. Node.js provides mechanisms like try-catch blocks and error events to handle errors. By catching and handling errors at appropriate levels, you can prevent them from propagating and causing the entire system to fail.

**Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing fallback mechanisms allows the system to switch to alternative methods or services when the primary ones are unavailable. For example, if a service that provides real-time data is down, the system can fall back to using cached data or a less real-time source.

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**: The Circuit Breaker pattern is often used in conjunction with the Graceful Degradation pattern. It monitors the availability of a service and automatically opens the circuit (stops sending requests) when the service is unresponsive. This prevents cascading failures and allows the system to gracefully degrade by using alternative paths or cached data.

**Timeouts and Retries**: Setting appropriate timeouts and implementing retry mechanisms can help handle temporary failures. By defining reasonable timeouts for requests and retries with exponential backoff, the system can gracefully degrade by retrying or moving on to alternative actions when a service is slow or unresponsive.

**Fallback UI/UX**: When certain features or services are unavailable, it is important to provide a fallback user interface or user experience. This can include displaying informative messages, disabling specific functionalities, or offering alternative options to the users.

## Example

```js
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    // Process the response and handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error gracefully
    if (error.response) {
      // The server responded with a status code outside the range of 2xx
      console.log('Request failed with status:', error.response.status);
      // Fallback to alternative data source or cached data
    } else if (error.request) {
      // The request was made but no response was received
      console.log('No response received');
      // Retry the request or fallback to alternative action
    } else {
      // Something happened in setting up the request
      console.log('Error:', error.message);
      // Fallback to alternative action or display informative message
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, the `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request using `axios`. If the request fails, different error scenarios are handled gracefully, allowing the system to degrade by falling back to alternative data sources or actions.

By implementing the Graceful Degradation pattern, Node.js applications can maintain their functionality and provide a better user experience even in the face of failures or degraded services. It promotes resilience and ensures that the system remains operational, even if not at full capacity, during challenging situations.

## Graceful shutdown

When working with microservices, it is important to implement a graceful shutdown pattern to ensure that the services can be **stopped gracefully without losing any data or causing any disruptions**. A graceful shutdown allows the services tocomplete any ongoing tasks, close connections*, and clean up resources before shutting down.

### Implementation

Handle the `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals: Node.js provides two signals, `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, which are sent when the process is being terminated. You can listen for these signals using the `process.on()` method.

```js
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  shutdown();
});

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  shutdown();
});

// handle uncaught exceptions to prevent the service from crashing unexpectedly
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
  shutdown();
});

const shutdown = () => {
  // Perform cleanup tasks
  // Close database connections
  // Stop ongoing tasks
  // Release resources

  // Exit the process
  process.exit(0);
};
```
