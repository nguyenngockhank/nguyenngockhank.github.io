## Service mesh

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communication.

## What’s the need for a service mesh?

Microservices enhance scalability but increase communication and security concerns. 

A service mesh addresses these issues by ensuring seamless communication among a constantly expanding set of services.

Let’s look at the core components of a service mesh.

The data plane contains lightweight proxies that are deployed alongside each service, often referred to as sidecars. These proxies handle all inbound and outbound traffic for the services

The control plane manages and configures these proxies, establishing and enforcing policies to ensure smooth and secure operations.

## Service mesh operations

### 1) Deployment and proxy injection

Each service gets a sidecar proxy, to manage inbound and outbound traffic.

### 2) Service discovery

Proxies use the control plane to find services and determine the best communication paths.

### 3) Traffic routing

Requests are directed based on predefined rules, optimizing load balancing and routing.

### 4) Security and policy enforcement

Traffic encryption and policy application occur automatically, ensuring secure and authorized communication.

### 5) Observability and monitoring

Proxies collect metrics and logs, providing visibility into system performance and service health.

### 6) Failure recovery

The control plane dictates recovery actions like retries or alternative routings in case of service failures.


The primary benefits of a service mesh are improved security through encryption, automated communication activities, and simplified microservice management. It also enhances system observability and dependability through effective failure recovery techniques.

A service mesh can help manage the inherent complexities of microservices architecture. Its capabilities in enhancing security, observability, and dependability have made it very popular in microservice environments.
