## Using 2PC between Postgres and MySQL

To use 2PC between Postgres and MySQL, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install the PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) extension on the Postgres server. This extension allows Postgres to access data from other databases, including MySQL.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;
```

2. Create a foreign server object in Postgres that points to the MySQL server. This object contains the connection information for the MySQL server, such as the hostname, port, username, and password.

```sql
CREATE SERVER mysql_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (host 'mysql.example.com', port '3306', dbname 'mydb', username 'myuser', password 'mypassword');
```

3. Create a user mapping in Postgres that maps a Postgres user to a MySQL user. This mapping allows Postgres to authenticate with the MySQL server using the specified MySQL user credentials.

```sql
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR postgres SERVER mysql_server OPTIONS (username 'myuser', password 'mypassword');
```

4. Create a foreign table in Postgres that represents the table in MySQL that you want to access. This table definition includes the table name, column definitions, and any necessary options.
