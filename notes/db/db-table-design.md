##  Polymorphic DB Table Design

Look at [Example Person and Organization Example](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/179654/developing-a-database-for-a-funds-transfers-business-where-a-people-and-organi)

Key takeaways:
- "As demonstrated, Person and Organization are depicted as mutually exclusive subtypes of Party."
- "The Party **supertype** holds a discriminator (i.e., PartyTypeCode) and all the properties (or attributes) that are common to its **subtypes**, which, in turn, have the properties that apply to each of them."

Result DB diagram. Pay attention to how the polymorphic relationships resolved using this design:
- Person is-a Party
- Organization is-a Party
- PartyTypeCode is the **discriminator**

## Thoughts on Foreign Keys 
At GitHub we do not use foreign keys, ever, anywhere.

- FKs are in your way to shard your database. Your app is accustomed to rely on FK to maintain integrity, instead of doing it on its own. It may even rely on FK to cascade deletes (shudder). When eventually you want to shard or extract data out, you need to change & test the app to an unknown extent.
- FKs are a performance impact. The fact they require indexes is likely fine, since those indexes are needed anyhow. But the lookup made for each `insert`/`delete` is an overhead.
- FKs don't work well with online schema migrations.
