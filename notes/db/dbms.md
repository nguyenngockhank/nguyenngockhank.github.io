# DBMS Notes

- DBMS: Database Managment System

## Data vs Information

Data | Information
------| ----
Data refers to raw facts that have no specific meaning | Information refers to processed data that has a purpose & meaning 
`Data` is derived from Latin word `datum`, which means `something that is given` | Information is derived from Latin word `informatio`, which means `formation or conception`
The data is independent of the information | Information is dependent on data
Data or raw data is not enough to make decision | The information is sufficient to help make a decision in the respective context

::: tip 
Note: In a computer, the CPU is the brain where 'P' stands for processing or data processing. The fundamental purpose of a computer system is to process **data** into **information**.

## Components

[Five Major Components of DBMS](https://www.tutorialsmate.com/2022/01/components-of-dbms.html)

### Hardware

Hardware is a set of physical electronic devices such as `computers and their components`, which include I/O devices for data in or out, storage devices, and other physical components

One cannot implement or use DBMS without hardware. Databases are created, accessed, and/or managed using a range of machines from microcomputers to mainframes. When we run any database management system, such as Oracle, MySQL, etc. on our PC, then the computer parts like the mouse, keyboard, RAM, ROM, hard-disk all become part of DBMS hardware.

::: tip
A database is defined as a collection of logically related information that is securely organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and/or updated using a DBMS.

### Software

Software is one of the main components of a database management system. The software includes `DBMS software`, `operating systems`, `network-based programs` that help in sharing data between users, and `application software` to help users to access data within a database.

### Data

Data is another important component in a database management system environment as DBMS mainly exists to collect, store, access, and process data. 

### Database Access Language

Database Access Language is a simple language that allows users to write commands to perform desired operations on the data stored in the database.

### Procedures

Procedures refer to the rules and instructions that help to design and use a database management system.
