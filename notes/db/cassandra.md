# Apache Cassandra

- Developed by Facebook in 2007. Gifted to Apache 2/2010
- NoSQL but has structure 
- A database - column family
- Can use SQL to manipulate with data
- Peer to peer database, sharding, more nodes more performance

## Column-oriented Database

Its architecture uses (a) persistent, sparse matrix, multi-dimensional mapping (row-value, column-value, and timestamp) in a tabular format meant for massive scalability (over and above the petabyte scale).

## Ring cluster

![cluster](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/_images/diagrams/apache-cassandra-diagrams-01.jpg)

- Each nodes will be assigned a range of token.
- Client could connect any nodes to write, that node will become **coordinator** node.
- Partition keys will be hashed into a token. Coordinator will base on the token to know which node we can store the data.

## Replication Factor

- Replication Factor (RF) = number copies we want to store
- Replication node will be defined by Replication Strategy
- Simple strategy = next 2 nodes

## Data consistency

| WRITE | READ | Consistent | Read Availability | Write Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | ✅   | Low | Low |
| Quorum | All | ✅   | Low | Medium |
| ✅  One | All | ✅   | Low | High |
| All | Quorum | ✅   | Medium | Low |
| ✅ Quorum | Quorum | ✅   | Medium | Medium |
| One | Quorum | ❌   | Medium | High |
| ✅ All | One | ✅   | High | Low |
| Quorum | One | ❌   | High | Medium |
| One | One | ❌   | High | High |


##  Keys

- Each table requires a unique **primary key**. 
- The first field listed is the **partition key**, since its hashed value is used to determine the node to store the data. 
- If those fields are wrapped in parentheses then the partition key is **composite**. Otherwise the first field is the partition key. 
- Any fields listed after the partition key are called **clustering columns**. These store data in ascending or descending order within the partition for the fast retrieval of similar values. 
- All the fields together are the **primary key**.

All data has the same partison key will be store at the same node

We should only access data using the partison key

*Every node has 256 virtual nodes in default*


## CQL

Tables should reflect the queries we are trying to make

### Keyspace

:::: tabs

::: tab Create
```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE test_keyspace 
WITH replication = { 'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'} 
    AND durable_writes = 'true';
```

```
USE test_keyspace;
```
:::

::: tab Describe
```sql
DESCRIBE KEYSPACES
```
:::

::: tab Drop
```sql
DROP KEYSPACE test_keyspace;
```
:::

::::


### Table

:::: tabs

::: tab Create
```sql
CREATE TABLE employee_by_id ( 
    id int,
    name text,
    position text,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```
:::


::: tab Alter
```sql
ALTER TABLE employee_by_id
ADD phone set<text>;
```
:::

::: tab Describe
```sql
DESCRIBE TABLES
```

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE employee_by_id
```
:::

::::

### Selection

Write time
```sql
SELECT car_make, car_model, writetime(car_model)
FROM employee_by_car_make;
```

Allow filtering

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_by_id
WHERE name = 'John' ALLOW FILTERING;
```

### Update

Time to live (60seconds), value will be `null` after the given time.

**Use case**: token / coupon is only valid in 24hours

```sql
UPDATE employee_by_car_make 
USING TTL 60 
SET car_model='TRUCK'
WHERE car_make'BMW' AND id='2';
```

### Collections

```sql
UPDATE employee_by_id
SET phone = {'123', '321'}
WHERE id = 1
```

Append
```sql
UPDATE employee_by_id
SET phone = phone + {'555', '444'}
WHERE id = 1
```

Remove 
```sql
UPDATE employee_by_id
SET phone = phone - {'555'}
WHERE id = 1
```

### UUID

:::: tabs

::: tab UUID

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee_by_uuid ( 
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name text,
    last_name text
); 
```

```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE employee_by_uuid ( id, first_name, last_name) 
VALUES (uuid(), 'tom', 'jerry');
```
:::

::: tab TimeUUID
```sql
CREATE TABLE employee_by_uuid ( 
    id timeuuid PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name text,
    last_name text
); 
```

```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE employee_by_uuid ( id, first_name, last_name) 
VALUES (now(), 'tom', 'jerry');
```
