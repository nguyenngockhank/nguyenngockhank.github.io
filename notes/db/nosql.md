# NoSQL

## Definition

*There's no strong definition of the concept out there, no trademarks, no standard group, not even a manifesto.*

Some characteristics are common amongst these databases, but none are definitional.
- Not using the relational model (nor the SQL language)
- Open source
- Designed to run on large clusters
- Based on the needs of 21st century web properties
- No schema, allowing fields to be added to any record without controls

## Why NoSql?

- Relational databases have been a successful technology for twenty years, providing persistence, concurrency control, and an integration mechanism.
- Application developers have been frustrated with the impedance mismatch between the relational model and the in-memory data structures.
- There is a movement away from using databases as integration points towards encapsulating databases within applications and integrating through services.
- The vital factor for a change in data storage was the need to support large volumes of data by running on clusters. Relational databases are not designed to run efficiently on clusters.
- NoSQL is an accidental neologism. There is no prescriptive definitionâ€”all you can make is an observation of common characteristics.
- The most important result of the rise of NoSQL is Polyglot Persistence.

## Data Models

- Document
- Column-family
- Key-value
- Graph

## Aggregate Data Model

An aggregate is a collection of data that we interact with as a unit. Aggregates form the boundaries for ACID operations with the database.

Key-value, document, and column-family databases can all be seen as forms of aggregate-oriented database.

Aggregates make it easier for the database to manage data storage over clusters.

Aggregate-oriented databases **work best when most data interaction is done with the same aggregate**; aggregate-ignorant databases are better when interactions use data organized in many different formations.

## Distribution Models

There are two styles of distributing data:
- **Sharding distributes** different data across multiple servers, so each server acts as the single source for a subset of data.
- **Replication** copies data across multiple servers, so each bit of data can be found in multiple places.

A system may use either or both techniques.

Replication comes in two forms:
- **Master-slave replication** makes one node the authoritative copy that handles writes while slaves synchronize with the master and may handle reads.
- **Peer-to-peer replication** allows writes to any node; the nodes coordinate to synchronize their copies of the data.

Master-slave replication reduces the chance of update conflicts but peer-to-peer replication avoids loading all writes onto a single point of failure.

## Row oriented vs. Column oriented

| Row oriented DB | Column oriented DB |
| :-------------- | :----------------- |
| stored and retrieved one row at a time and hence could read unnecessary data if some of the data in a row are required. | stored and retrieve in columns and hence it can only able to read only the relevant data if required. |
| Records are easy to read and write. | Read and write operations are slower as compared to row-oriented. |
| best suited for **online transaction system**. | best suited for **online analytical processing**. |
| These are not efficient in performing operations applicable to the entire datasets and hence aggregation in row-oriented is an expensive job or operations. | These are efficient in performing operations applicable to the entire dataset and hence enables aggregation over many rows and columns. |
| Typical compression mechanisms which provide less efficient result than what we achieve from column-oriented data stores. | These type of data stores basically permits high compression rates due to little distinct or unique values in columns. | 



## Sql vs. NoSql

<!-- ![SQL vs NoSQL](./img/sql-nosql-compare.png) -->

|  | NoSQL | SQL
| -- | -------|--------|
| **Model** | Non-relational | Relational |
|    | Stores data in JSON documents. key/value pairs, wide column stores, or graphs | Stores data in a table |
| **Data** | Offers flexibility as not every record needs to store the same properties  | Great for solutions where every record has the same properties |
| | New properties can be added on the fly | Adding a new property may require altering schemas or backfilling data |
| | Relationships are often captured by denormalizing data and presenting all data for an object in a single record | Relationships are often captured in normalized model using joins to resolve references across tables |
| | Good for semi-structured, complex or nested data | Good for structured data |
| **Schema** | Dynamic or flexible schemas | Strict schema |
| |  Database is schema-agnostic and the schema is dictated by the application. This allows for agility and highly itertive development | Schema must be maintained and kept in sync between application and database |
| **Transactions** |  ACID transaction support varies per solution | Supports ACID transactions |
| **Consistency & Availability** |  Eventual to strong consistency supported, depending on solution  | Strong consistency enforced |
| | Consistency, availability, and performance can be traded to meet the needs of the application (CAP theorem) |  Consistency is prioritized over availability and performance |
| **Performance** |  Performance can be maximized by reducing consistency, if needed | Insert and update performance is dependent upon how fast a write is committed, as strong consistency is enforced. Performance can be maximized by using scaling up available resources and using in-memory structures. |
| | All information about an entity is typically in a single record, so an update can happen in one operation | Information about an entity may be spread across many tables or rows, requiring many joins to complete an update or a query | 
| **Scale** | Scaling is typically achieved horizontally with data partitioned to span servers | Scaling is typically achieved vertically with more server resources |


- **SQL**: Structured Query Language
- **UnQL**: Unstructured Query Language
- **ACID**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability
- **CAP**: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance
