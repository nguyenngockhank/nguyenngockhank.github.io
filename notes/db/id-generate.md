## DB Auto-increment
- ✅ Easy to setup 
- ❌ Only works in a singler server setup 
- ❌ Security issue See: Insecure direct object references

## UUID
- ✅ Easy to generate, globally unique 
- ❌ Very long, not sorted by time, not numeric

## DB ticket server
- ✅ DB Auto-increment is well understood
- ❌ Single Point Of Failure (SPOF) if a server is used
- ❌ IDs are not sorted if multiple servers are used

## Redis
- ✅ Dont rely on DB
- ❌ Adding or removing Redis servers cause complexity

## Twitter Snowflake Id
- ✅ Open sourced by Twitter
- ✅ Widely used in the industry
- ✅ Dicord / Twitter used this
