# Javascript 

## First class functions
- functions can take as arguments other functions 
- functions can be returned by functions
- functions can assigned to a variable

## Higher-order functions 
- takes one or more functions as arguments
- returns a function as its result. 

## Callback functions 
-  passed into another function as an argument

## Curry functions
- A curried function is a function of several arguments `rewritten` such that it `accepts the first argument` and `returns a function` that accepts the second argument and so on. 

**Notes**: [Create By Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#curry)

## Hoisting
- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

## Closure
- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) `with references to its surrounding state` (the lexical environment). 
- Not only Javascript, PHP has this term also.
