Floating point values, or even (Double precision floating point format), should be avoided when using a currency amount with fractions (like Dollars and cents), in its nature, it cannot be stored exactly as is in memory. 

Say we want to store 0.1 dollars, any floating-point data type can not store it as is, it get‚Äôs stored as an approximation (0.10000000149‚Ä¶.). 

When doing a series of math operations, some problem can rise, that is called (loss of significance), the errors can be amplified and cause trouble üßê.
the solution is simple in swift, use NSNumber

````
let myBalance = 12.333
let decimal: Decimal = NSNumber(floatLiteral: 12.333).decimalValue
let result = decimal / 3
```
