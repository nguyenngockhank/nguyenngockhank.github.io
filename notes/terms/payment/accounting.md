### Double-Entry Bookkeeping

Double-entry bookkeeping is a fundamental accounting method where every financial transaction is recorded with equal and opposite entries in at least two accounts. This system ensures that the accounting equation (`Assets = Liability + Equity`) always balances.

::: tip Core Principles:
- Every transaction affects at least two accounts.
- For each transaction, there's at least one debit and one credit.
- Total debits must always equal total credits.

## Why is a debit card called a “debit” card?

- Each transaction in the business system is transformed into at least two journal lines in the ledger system. This is called **double-entry** accounting, where every transaction must have a source account and a target account.
- Each journal line is booked to an account. 
- Each account belongs to one of the three components in the balance sheet:

>  Asset = Liability + Equity

Bob pays $100 to the merchant with a debit card. We have two accounts involved in this transaction:

- **Journal line 1** - From the issuing bank’s point of view, Bob’s bank account is a liability (because the bank owes Bob money). Bob’s bank account is deducted $100. 
This is a **debit** record.
- **Journal line 2** - Bank’s cash is an asset and the bank’s cash is deducted by $100.
This is a **credit** record.

The balance sheet equation still balances with the two journal lines recorded in the ledger.
 
Bob’s card is called a **“debit”** card because it is a **debit record** when paying with a debit card. 

::: danger Why is this important? 
This is how a ledger system is designed, only a real ledger is more complicated. 
Applying these strict accounting rules makes reconciliation much easier!
