## Payment Processor vs. Payment Gateway

### Payment Gateway

- **Transmits data**: Encrypts and sends this information to the payment processor.   
- **Provides feedback**: Communicates the transaction's approval or decline back to the merchant.   


### Payment Processor
- **The backend**: Handles the complex process of routing and processing the transaction.   
- **Verifies information**: Checks the validity of the payment information.   
- **Authorizes transaction**: Communicates with the customer's bank to authorize the purchase.   
- **Transfers funds**: Facilitates the transfer of funds from the customer's bank to the merchant's account.   
- **Fraud prevention**: Implements security measures to protect against fraudulent transactions.

### Summarization
