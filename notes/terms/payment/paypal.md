# Paypal notes

PayPal can be considered both a digital wallet and a payment processor. 

## PayPal as a Digital Wallet
- **Stores payment information**: You can link multiple credit cards, debit cards, and bank accounts to your PayPal account.   
- **Enables quick payments**: With saved payment information, you can quickly and securely make online purchases.   
- **Offers additional features**: PayPal often provides features like sending money to friends, requesting payments, and managing your balance.   

## PayPal as a Payment Processor
- **Accepts payments**: Businesses can integrate PayPal into their checkout process, allowing customers to pay with their PayPal balance or linked cards.   
- **Provides payment processing services**: PayPal handles transaction processing, fraud prevention, and chargebacks for businesses. 

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Payment Service

PayPal is one of the most well-known and widely used P2P payment services. It allows individuals to send and receive money directly to each other without the need for traditional banking intermediaries.

### Cross-Border Context
Key aspects of PayPal's cross-border P2P:
- **Global reach**: PayPal operates in many countries, allowing for a wide range of cross-border transactions.
- **Currency conversion**: PayPal automatically converts currencies for cross-border payments, making it convenient for users.
- **Fees**: While PayPal offers cross-border P2P, it's essential to be aware of potential fees, including currency conversion fees and transaction fees.
- **Speed**: Transaction times can vary depending on the countries involved and the chosen funding source.
- **Regulations**: Cross-border payments are subject to various regulations, and PayPal complies with these to ensure smooth transactions.

**Important Considerations:**
- **Exchange rates**: PayPal uses its own exchange rates, which might differ from the mid-market rate.
- **Transfer limits**: There might be limits on the amount of money you can send or receive in a specific period.
- **Receiving money**: Ensure the recipient has a PayPal account in their local currency to avoid additional fees.
