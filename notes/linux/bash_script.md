# Bash script

A Bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the Bash shell, a command-line interpreter in Linux and other Unix-like systems. By writing these scripts, you can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort. Â

- **Shebang Line**
    - The first line of a Bash script typically starts with `#!/bin/bash`.
    - This line tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script.
- Comments: Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and are ignored by the interpreter.
- Variables: They are declared without a specific data type.
- Control flow: `if` / `else` / `elif`, `for` / `done`
- Functions
