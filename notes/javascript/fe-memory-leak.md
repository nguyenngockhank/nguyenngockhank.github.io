# Frontend Memory Leaks

As applications get more complicated and powerful, there is an increasing need to improve performance.

To help meet performance goals engineering teams have turned their attention to improving **system inefficiencies**, such as memory leaks.

**Garbage collection** is an important component in memory management. It is an automated process that **identifies and frees up memory that's no longer in use by the application.**

**Memory leaks** result from poorly managed memory allocation. When memory is not properly freed after it is used, leaks occur which causes unnecessary resource consumption.

Frontend memory leaks can have a significant impact on the performance of web applications. They can cause pages to load slowly, use up unnecessary memory, and occasionally cause crashes.

They can be a serious problem in single-page applications (SPAs) where pages remain in the browser for extended periods, allowing memory leaks to build up.

## Causes
Memory leaks can be caused by various factors, but some common culprits include the following:

### Uncleared event listeners

Event listeners are attached to elements in the DOM, forgetting to remove these listeners prevents the element from being garbage collected. This means that the element will continue to consume resources, even if theyâ€™re no longer part of the DOM.

### Out-of-scope references

Closure functions that refer to variables outside of their scope keep these variables in memory.

Memory leaks occur if references to objects are not cleared.

### Long-lived variables

Variables that contain large objects should be cleared once they're no longer needed to limit unnecessary memory usage.

### Lingering resources

Open connections or streams to external resources can lead to a considerable amount of resource consumption.

Detecting memory leaks is a difficult challenge.

Browser developer tools such as memory profilers can help identify areas that need the most attention.

These tools have advanced capabilities to help further investigate potential memory leaks, such as capturing heap snapshots and detailed memory allocation tracking.

Monitoring tools  should be used to track trends and identify spikes in memory usage and drops in performance.

Advanced tools provide garbage collection insights that let you know how often the garbage collector process runs, and how much memory is freed up each time.

## Solution
The best way to avoid memory leaks is to set up processes that prevent them from reaching production. **Thorough code reviews and testing** are key lines of defense.

**Load tests are particularly helpful** as memory leaks tend to become more apparent during high levels of load.

To effectively catch memory leaks during code reviews, developers must have a solid understanding of the best practices for avoiding them. Below are some key approaches to ensure optimal memory usage and prevent potential issues:

- **Clear event listeners** once they are no longer needed.
- **Avoid global variables.**
- **Release connections or streams** to external resources when they are no longer in use.
- Clear large data structures and remove their references.

Improving memory management and monitoring for memory leaks can lead to better, more reliable web applications that deliver a seamless user experience while minimizing resource wastage.
