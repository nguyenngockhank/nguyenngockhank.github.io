# Load balancers

## Static Algorithms

### Round robin
The client requests are sent to different service instances in sequential order. The services are usually required to be stateless.

### Sticky round-robin
This is an improvement of the round-robin algorithm. If Aliceâ€™s first request goes to service A, the following requests go to service A as well.

### Weighted round-robin
The admin can specify the weight for each service. The ones with a higher weight handle more requests than others.

### Hash
This algorithm applies a hash function on the incoming requests' IP or URL. The requests are routed to relevant instances based on the hash function result.

## Dynamic Algorithms

### Least connections
A new request is sent to the service instance with the least concurrent connections.

### Least response time
A new request is sent to the service instance with the fastest response time.
