# Data structure

A good engineer needs to recognize how data structures are used in our daily lives.

- **list**: keep your Twitter feeds
- **stack**: support undo/redo of the word editor
- **queue**: keep printer jobs, or send user actions in-game
- **heap**: task scheduling
- **tree**: keep the HTML document, or for AI decision
- **suffix tree**: for searching string in a document
- **graph**: for tracking friendship, or path finding
- **r-tree**: for finding the nearest neighbor
- **vertex buffer**: for sending data to GPU for rendering
