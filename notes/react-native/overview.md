# RN overview

React Native is a free, open-source framework developed by Meta Platforms that allows developers to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. It's built on the JavaScript programming language and is often used to create applications that are indistinguishable from those built with native languages like Swift or Java. 

## Benefits

React Native's main selling point is its **cross-platform capabilities**
- **Code Reusability**: Developers can reuse up to 90% of their code between Android and iOS.
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: The ability to use one codebase drastically reduces development time, letting businesses launch their apps sooner.
- **Hot Reloading**: This feature lets developers see changes to their code in real-time without having to fully recompile the app, speeding up the development and debugging process.
- **Native Performance**: Unlike older "hybrid" frameworks that used web views, React Native renders components using native APIs. This results in apps with performance and responsiveness that are very close to that of a truly native app.
- **Strong Community**: As an open-source project, React Native has a large and active community of developers, which provides extensive documentation, support, and third-party libraries.


## How it works
React Native works by using a "**bridge**" to communicate between JavaScript code and native platform code.
