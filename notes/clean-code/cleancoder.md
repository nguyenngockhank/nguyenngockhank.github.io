### THE REASON IT ALL EXISTS
A software system exists to provide value to its users. This has to be taken into account before every decision, even though the value as a measure is relative.

### KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID!)

All designs should be as simple as possible. Simple designs are usually the most elegant ones (more maintainable and less error-prone).

### MAINTAIN THE VISION

A clear vision is essential to the success of a software project. The lack of conceptual integrity can lead to multiple different abstractions not working together properly.

### WHAT YOU PRODUCE, OTHERS WILL CONSUME

The system will be used by others, so, keep the audience in mind during the development. Try to produce something easy to use, maintain, etc.

### BE OPEN TO THE FUTURE
Reuse saves time and effort. If you can achieve it communicate the reuse opportunities to your peers. They cannot use something they do not know exists.

### PLAN AHEAD FOR REUSE
A software system exists to provide value to its users. This has to be taken into account before every decision, even though the value as a measure is relative.

### THINK!
Clear, complete thought before action almost results in better outcomes. Even if the initial thought is not correct it helps to learn and to improve for the future.


## 7 WASTES OF SW DEV

Similar to what Toyota Production System identified as seven categories of waste in manufacturing, also software development has its own wastes.

#### PARTIALLY DONE WORK
The work which is not complete does not bring any value.
Furthermore, it creates additional constraints to keep it in a usable state.

### RELEARNING
Developing software is heavily based on learning. Making the same mistakes over again can be omitted by capitalizing on the first occurrence of a mistake.

### HANDOFFS
Handoffs create extra work by a need to shift information. A lot of information is lost during these shifts.

### DELAYS
In order to keep the context fresh fast feedback is important. The bigger the delay in getting feedback the harder it becomes to capitalize on it.

### EXTRA FEATURES
Understanding customer needs is crucial to delivering real value by building the right thing.

### TASK SWITCHING
Every context switch creates a must to change focus, and readjust for other tasks, resulting in lower productivity.

### DEFECTS
Creating defects boomerang back, creating extra work, and slowing down new development

## 14 Common Product Development Biases To Watch Out For

### Premature convergence

The tendency to settle on a solution too quickly, without fully exploring alternative options. Have we fully explored other options before deciding on this solution?

### High planning inventory
Accumulation of planned tasks and ideas that remain unimplemented, leading to inefficiencies and delays. Are we accumulating too many planned tasks without taking action?

### Shiny objects
The attraction to new, exciting ideas or technologies at the expense of focusing on core product development goals. Are we getting distracted by new ideas instead of focusing on our core goals?

### Short-term impact
Prioritizing immediate results over long-term value, potentially sacrificing product quality or sustainability. Are we sacrificing long-term value for immediate results?

### Large batches
Working on large units of work, leading to longer lead times and reduced flexibility. Are we breaking work down into appropriately sized batches to maintain flexibility and responsiveness?

### Predictability and certainty
A focus on ensuring a predictable development process, often at the expense of innovation and adaptability. Are we prioritizing predictability over innovation and adaptability?

### Late integration
Delaying the combination of different components or features, which can lead to unforeseen issues and increased complexity. Are we waiting too long to combine components, risking complexity and issues?

### Delaying feedback
Postponing the collection and incorporation of user feedback, risking the development of an unsuitable or undesirable product. Are we postponing user feedback, jeopardizing product outcomes?

### Parallelization
Running multiple tasks or processes concurrently, aiming to speed up development but potentially causing conflicts or dependencies. Are we running too many tasks concurrently, causing potential conflicts?

### Starting in isolation:
Initiating work within small groups, without involving the entire team or related stakeholders, leading to misalignment and less collaboration. Are we excluding important stakeholders from early development stages?

### "Ship and forget"
Releasing a product without ongoing support, maintenance, or updates, leading to user dissatisfaction and potential obsolescence. Are we missing opportunities to iterate on behalf of our customers?

### Individual work assignments
Allocating tasks to single team members, potentially limiting collaboration and knowledge sharing. Are we limiting collaboration by assigning tasks to single team members?

### Prioritize output over outcomes
Emphasizing the quantity of work produced, rather than the overall value or success of the product. Are we focusing more on work quantity than product success?

### Specialization
Focusing on individual areas of expertise, which can create silos and inhibit cross-functional collaboration. Is our focus on expertise creating silos and hindering cross-functional collaboration?
