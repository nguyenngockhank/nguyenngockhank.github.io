# Managing Dependencies

**Minimize dependencies**: Aim to keep the number of dependencies as low as possible. Having too many dependencies can make the codebase complex and difficult to understand. Evaluate each dependency and consider if it is truly necessary.

**Use dependency injection**: Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows you to inject dependencies into a class rather than having the class create them itself. This promotes loose coupling and makes the code more modular and testable. There are various dependency injection frameworks available for different programming languages.

**Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class or module should have a single responsibility. This helps in reducing dependencies between different components and makes the codebase more maintainable. If a class has multiple responsibilities, consider refactoring it into smaller, more focused classes.

**Avoid circular dependencies**: Circular dependencies occur when two or more modules depend on each other. This can lead to a tangled and hard-to-maintain codebase. To avoid circular dependencies, analyze the dependencies between modules and refactor the code if necessary.

**Use interfaces or abstractions**: Instead of depending on concrete implementations, depend on interfaces or abstractions. This allows for easier swapping of implementations and promotes flexibility. It also helps in writing unit tests by allowing the use of mock objects.

**Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update the dependencies used in your codebase to their latest versions. This ensures that you benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. However, be cautious when updating major versions, as they may introduce breaking changes.

**Document dependencies**: Clearly document the dependencies of your codebase, including their versions and any specific configurations or requirements. This helps other developers understand the requirements and set up the development environment correctly.

## Dependency Injection?

Using dependency injection has several benefits:

- **Modularity**: By decoupling dependencies, each component becomes more modular and can be developed and tested independently.
- **Testability**: With dependency injection, it becomes easier to write unit tests for individual components, as dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced with test doubles.
- **Flexibility**: Dependency injection allows for easy swapping of dependencies, making it possible to change implementations without modifying the code that uses them.
- **Maintainability**: By reducing the coupling between components, the codebase becomes easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

### How to Use

1. Identify Dependencies: Identify the dependencies that a class requires to perform its tasks. These dependencies can be other classes, interfaces, or even configuration values.
2. Define Interfaces: If the dependencies are other classes, define interfaces that represent the contract between the class and its dependencies. This allows for loose coupling and easier substitution of implementations.
3. Create a Dependency Injector: Create a dependency injector or use an existing dependency injection framework. This injector will be responsible for providing the dependencies to the classes that need them.
4. Configure Dependencies: Configure the dependency injector to associate the interfaces with their concrete implementations. This can be done through configuration files, annotations, or code.
5. Inject Dependencies: In the classes that require dependencies, use constructor injection, setter injection, or method injection to receive the dependencies from the injector. Constructor injection is often considered the best practice as it ensures that the dependencies are available when the object is created.
6. Use the Dependencies: Once the dependencies are injected, the class can use them to perform its tasks. The class does not need to know how the dependencies are created or managed.

### Example

```java
public interface UserRepository {
    void save(User user);
}

public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public void createUser(User user) {
        // Perform user creation logic
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserRepository userRepository = new UserRepositoryImpl(); // Concrete implementation
        UserService userService = new UserService(userRepository);

        User user = new User("John Doe");
        userService.createUser(user);
    }
}
```

In this example, the UserService class depends on the `UserRepository` interface. The concrete implementation of the `UserRepository` is provided externally through the constructor of the `UserService` class. This allows for loose coupling between the two classes and makes it easy to swap different implementations of the `UserRepository` without modifying the `UserService` class.
