## Public IP vs AWS Elastic IP (EIP)

Feature | Public IP | Elastic IP 
--------| ----------| ----------
WHAT    | A public IP is assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv4, not associate with your Account | Static public IP Address, and associated with vour account 
COST    | Free | Charged if not associate or instance stopped
Static or Dynamic | Dynamic. Changed every time if stop and start |  Static 
No IP per instance | 1 | Can add more than one. Additional EIP will be charged
Quotas |  Unlimited | 5
Share publicity | ✅, but not recommended. | ✅
Recovery | ❌ | You may get it back if not associate to someone else

## EC2 Instance Store

- Provide temporary block level storage for instance
- The storage is a disk that physically attached to host
- Ideal workload: buffers, caches, scratch data, temporary content
- Data is lost when:
- Underlying disk drive fails
- Instance stop / hibernates / terminates
- Very high IOPS: up to million IOPS (Eg: i3.16xlarge 3.3M read and 1.4M write IOPS)
- Ref: [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage-optimized-instances.html#storage-instances-diskperf)

    - Afterinstall
    - AfterAllow TestTraffic
    - BeforeAllowTraffic
    - AfterAllowTraffic
- Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.html

## Nitro System

AWS has completely re-imagined our virtualization infrastructure. 

Traditionally, hypervisors protect the physical hardware and bios, virtualize the CPU, storage, networking, and provide a rich set of management capabilities. 

With the Nitro System, we are able to break apart those functions, offload them to dedicated hardware and software, and reduce costs by delivering practically all of the resources of a server to your instances.

- Divided in parts: Nitro Card, Nitro Security Chip, Nitro Hypervisor, Nitro Enclaves, NitroTPM (in 2022)
- In Development since 2013
- Launched in Nov 2017
- All new launches use Nitro
