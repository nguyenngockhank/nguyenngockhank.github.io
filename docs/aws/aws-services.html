With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.</p> <p>Amazon ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type. With Fargate launch type, all you have to do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory requirements,define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. EC2 launch type allows you to have server-level, more granular control over the infrastructure that runs your container applications. With EC2 launch type, you can use Amazon ECS to manage a cluster of servers and schedule placement of containers on the servers. Amazon ECS keeps track of all the CPU, memory and other resources in your cluster, and also finds the best server for a container to run on based on your specified resource requirements. You are responsible for provisioning, patching, and scaling clusters of servers. You can decide which type of server to use, which applications and how many containers to run in a cluster to optimize utilization, and when you should add or remove servers from a cluster. EC2 launch type gives you more control of your server clusters and provides a broader range of customization options, which might be required to support some specific applications or possible compliance and government requirements.</p> <h3 id="aws-lambda"><a href="#aws-lambda" class="header-anchor">#</a> AWS Lambda</h3> <div class="el-tabs el-tabs--top el-tabs--border-card"><div class="el-tabs__header is-top"><div class="el-tabs__nav-wrap is-top"><div class="el-tabs__nav-scroll"><div role="tablist" class="el-tabs__nav is-top" style="transform:translateX(-0px);"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-tabs__content"><div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Lambda/Diagrams/product-page-diagram_Lambda-RealTimeFileProcessing.a59577de4b6471674a540b878b0b684e0249a18c.png" alt="igm"></p></div> <div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Lambda/Diagrams/product-page-diagram_Lambda-RealTimeStreamProcessing.d79d55b5f3a5d6b58142a6c0fc8a29eadc81c02b.png" alt="igm"></p></div> <div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Lambda/Diagrams/product-page-diagram_Lambda-WebApplications%202.c7f8cf38e12cb1daae9965ca048e10d676094dc1.png" alt="igm"></p></div> <div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Lambda/Diagrams/product-page-diagram_Lambda-IoTBackends.3440c7f50a9b73e6a084a242d44009dc0fbe5fab.png" alt="igm"></p></div> <div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Lambda/Diagrams/product-page-diagram_Lambda-MobileBackends_option2.00f6421e67e8d6bdbc59f3a2db6fa7d7f8508073.png" alt="igm"></p></div></div></div> <p>AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.</p> <p>Ledgers are typically used to record a history of economic and financial activity in an organization. Many organizations build applications with ledger-like functionality because they want to maintain an accurate history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the history of credits and debits in banking transactions, verifying the data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. Ledger applications are often implemented using custom audit tables or audit trails created in relational databases. However, building audit functionality with relational databases is time- consuming and prone to human error. It requires custom development, and since relational databases are not inherently immutable, any unintended changes to the data are hard to track and verify. Alternatively, blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger. However, this adds complexity as you need to set-up an entire blockchain network with multiple nodes, manage its infrastructure, and require the nodes to validate each transaction before it can be added to the ledger.</p> <p>Amazon QLDB is a new class of database that eliminates the need to engage in the complex development effort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data’s change history is immutable – it cannot be altered or deleted – and using cryptography, you can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to your application’s data. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, known as a journal, that tracks each application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API, a flexible document data model, and full support for transactions. QLDB is also serverless, so it automatically scales to support the demands of your application. There are no servers to manage and no read or write limits to configure. With QLDB, you only pay for what you use.</p> <h3 id="amazon-timestream"><a href="#amazon-timestream" class="header-anchor">#</a> Amazon Timestream</h3> <p>Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day at 1/10th the cost of relational databases. Driven by the rise of IoT devices, IT systems, and smart industrial machines, time-series data — data that measures how things change over time — is one of the fastest growing data types. Time-series data has specific characteristics such as typically arriving in time order form, data is append-only, and queries are always over a time interval. While relational databases can store this data, they are inefficient at processing this data as they lack optimizations such as storing and retrieving data by time intervals. Timestream is a purpose-built time series database that efficiently stores and processes this data by time intervals. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze log data for DevOps, sensor data for IoT applications, and industrial telemetry data for equipment maintenance. As your data grows over time, Timestream’s adaptive query processing engine understands its location and format, making your data simpler and faster to analyze.

You often have to configure, set up, and manage multiple services to power the backend. You also have to integrate each of those services into your application by writing multiple lines of code. However, as the number of application features grow, your code and release process becomes more complex and managing the backend requires more time.</p> <p>Amplify provisions and manages backends for your mobile applications. You just select the capabilities you need such as authentication, analytics, or offline data sync and Amplify will automatically provision and manage the AWS service that powers each of the capabilities. You can then integrate those capabilities into your application through the Amplify libraries and UI components.</p> <h3 id="aws-device-farm"><a href="#aws-device-farm" class="header-anchor">#</a> AWS Device Farm</h3> <p>AWS Device Farm is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time.

App Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications.</p> <p>Modern applications are often composed of multiple microservices that each perform a specific function. This architecture helps to increase the availability and scalability of the application by allowing each component to scale independently based on demand, and automatically degrading functionality when a component fails instead of going offline. Each microservice interacts with all the other microservices through an API. As the number of microservices grows within an application, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint the exact location of errors, re-route traffic after failures, and safely deploy code changes. Previously, this has required you to build monitoring and control logic directly into your code and redeploy your microservices every time there are changes.</p> <p>AWS App Mesh makes it easy to run microservices by providing consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. App Mesh removes the need to update application code to change how monitoring data is collected or traffic is routed between microservices.

This increases your application availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date locations of its resources.</p> <p>Modern applications are typically composed of multiple services that are accessible over an API and perform a specific function. Each service interacts with a variety of other resources such as databases, queues, object stores, and customer-defined microservices, and they also need to be able to find the location of all the infrastructure resources on which it depends, in order to function. You typically manually manage all these resource names and their locations within the application code. However, manual resource management becomes time consuming and error-prone as the number of dependent infrastructure resources increases or the number of microservices dynamically scale up and down based on traffic. You can also use third-party service discovery products, but this requires installing and managing additional software and infrastructure.</p> <p>Cloud Map allows you to register any application resources such as databases, queues, microservices, and other cloud resources with custom names.

As you grow the number of workloads running on AWS, you need to be able to scale your networks across multiple accounts and Amazon VPCs to keep up with the growth. Today, you can connect pairs of Amazon VPCs using peering. However, managing point-to-point connectivity across many Amazon VPCs, without the ability to centrally manage the connectivity policies, can be operationally costly and cumbersome. For on-premises connectivity, you need to attach your AWS VPN to each individual Amazon VPC. This solution can be time consuming to build and hard to manage when the number of VPCs grows into the hundreds.</p> <p>With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway in to each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks which act like spokes. This hub and spoke model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only has to connect to the Transit Gateway and not to every other network. Any new VPC is simply connected to the Transit Gateway and is then automatically available to every other network that is connected to the Transit Gateway. This ease of connectivity makes it easy to scale your network as you grow.</p> <h3 id="aws-vpn"><a href="#aws-vpn" class="header-anchor">#</a> AWS VPN</h3> <div class="el-tabs el-tabs--top el-tabs--border-card"><div class="el-tabs__header is-top"><div class="el-tabs__nav-wrap is-top"><div class="el-tabs__nav-scroll"><div role="tablist" class="el-tabs__nav is-top" style="transform:translateX(-0px);"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-tabs__content"><div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p>AWS Client VPN is used by your remote workforce to securely access resources both on AWS and within your on-premises networks.</p> <p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/products/vpn/Product-Page-Diagram_AWS-Client-VPN-Connect%402x.59faa6ee9ab62c876ad232cd6a7a7566b6c4219b.png" alt="img"></p></div> <div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p>AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted connections between your locations (such as data centers and remote offices) and your AWS resources.</p> <p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/products/vpn/Product-Page-Diagram_Accelerated-Site-to-Site-VPN%402x%20(1)1.ec2d3da789b5a8b389e71f32073d7cba2dab293a.png" alt="img"></p></div></div></div> <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Virtual Private Network<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network.

The service can be setup with just a few clicks
and scales automatically with your network traffic, so you don't have to worry about deploying and managing any infrastructure. AWS Network Firewall’s flexible rules engine lets you define firewall rules that give you fine-grained control over network traffic, such as blocking outbound Server Message Block (SMB) requests to prevent the spread of malicious activity. You can also import rules you’ve already written in common open source rule formats as well as enable integrations with managed intelligence feeds sourced by AWS partners. AWS Network Firewall works together with AWS Firewall Manager so you can build policies based on AWS Network Firewall rules and then centrally apply those policies across your VPCs and accounts.</p> <p>AWS Network Firewall includes features that provide protections from common network threats. AWS Network Firewall’s stateful firewall can incorporate context from traffic flows, like tracking connections and protocol identification, to enforce policies such as preventing your VPCs from accessing domains using an unauthorized protocol. AWS Network Firewall’s intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop traffic to known bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names.</p> <p>It’s easy to get started with AWS Network Firewall by visiting the Amazon VPC Console to create or import your firewall rules, group them into policies, and apply them to the VPCs you want to protect. AWS Network Firewall pricing is based on the number of firewalls deployed and the amount of traffic inspected.

You can access your file systems across AZs and AWS Regions and share files between thousands of Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers via AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.</p> <p>Amazon EFS is well suited to support a broad spectrum of use cases from highly parallelized, scale-out workloads that require the highest possible throughput to single-threaded, latency-sensitive workloads. Use cases such as lift-and-shift enterprise applications, big data analytics, web serving and content management, application development and testing, media and entertainment workflows, database backups, and container storage.</p> <h3 id="amazon-fsx-for-lustre"><a href="#amazon-fsx-for-lustre" class="header-anchor">#</a> Amazon FSx for Lustre</h3> <p>Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed file system that is optimized for compute-intensive workloads, such as high performance computing, machine learning, and media data processing workflows. Many of these applications require the high-performance and low latencies of scale-out, parallel file systems. Operating these file systems typically requires specialized expertise and administrative overhead, requiring you to provision storage servers and tune complex performance parameters. With Amazon FSx, you can launch and run a Lustre file system that can process massive data sets at up to hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput, millions of IOPS, and sub-millisecond latencies.</p> <p>Amazon FSx for Lustre is seamlessly integrated with Amazon S3, making it easy to link your long-term data sets with your high performance file systems to run compute-intensive workloads. You can automatically copy data from S3 to FSx for Lustre, run your workloads, and then write results back to S3. FSx for Lustre also enables you to burst your compute-intensive workloads from on-premises to AWS by allowing you to access your FSx file system over Amazon Direct Connect or VPN. FSx for Lustre helps you cost-optimize your storage for compute-intensive workloads: It provides cheap and performant non- replicated storage for processing data, with your long-term data stored durably in Amazon S3 or other low-cost data stores. With Amazon FSx, you pay for only the resources you use. There are no minimum commitments, upfront hardware or software costs, or additional fees.</p> <h3 id="amazon-fsx-for-windows-file-server"><a href="#amazon-fsx-for-windows-file-server" class="header-anchor">#</a> Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</h3> <p>...</p> <h3 id="amazon-simple-storage-service"><a href="#amazon-simple-storage-service" class="header-anchor">#</a> Amazon Simple Storage Service</h3> <p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/s3-pdp-redesign/product-page-diagram_Amazon-S3_HIW.cf4c2bd7aa02f1fe77be8aa120393993e08ac86d.png" alt="img"></p> <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
