This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.</p> <p>Amazon ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type. With Fargate launch type, all you have to do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory requirements,define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. EC2 launch type allows you to have server-level, more granular control over the infrastructure that runs your container applications. With EC2 launch type, you can use Amazon ECS to manage a cluster of servers and schedule placement of containers on the servers. Amazon ECS keeps track of all the CPU, memory and other resources in your cluster, and also finds the best server for a container to run on based on your specified resource requirements.

Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.</p> <p>Ledgers are typically used to record a history of economic and financial activity in an organization. Many organizations build applications with ledger-like functionality because they want to maintain an accurate history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the history of credits and debits in banking transactions, verifying the data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. Ledger applications are often implemented using custom audit tables or audit trails created in relational databases. However, building audit functionality with relational databases is time- consuming and prone to human error. It requires custom development, and since relational databases are not inherently immutable, any unintended changes to the data are hard to track and verify. Alternatively, blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger. However, this adds complexity as you need to set-up an entire blockchain network with multiple nodes, manage its infrastructure, and require the nodes to validate each transaction before it can be added to the ledger.</p> <p>Amazon QLDB is a new class of database that eliminates the need to engage in the complex development effort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data’s change history is immutable – it cannot be altered or deleted – and using cryptography, you can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to your application’s data. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, known as a journal, that tracks each application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API, a flexible document data model, and full support for transactions. QLDB is also serverless, so it automatically scales to support the demands of your application. There are no servers to manage and no read or write limits to configure. With QLDB, you only pay for what you use.</p> <h3 id="amazon-timestream"><a href="#amazon-timestream" class="header-anchor">#</a> Amazon Timestream</h3> <p>Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of events per day at 1/10th the cost of relational databases. Driven by the rise of IoT devices, IT systems, and smart industrial machines, time-series data — data that measures how things change over time — is one of the fastest growing data types. Time-series data has specific characteristics such as typically arriving in time order form, data is append-only, and queries are always over a time interval. While relational databases can store this data, they are inefficient at processing this data as they lack optimizations such as storing and retrieving data by time intervals. Timestream is a purpose-built time series database that efficiently stores and processes this data by time intervals. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze log data for DevOps, sensor data for IoT applications, and industrial telemetry data for equipment maintenance. As your data grows over time, Timestream’s adaptive query processing engine understands its location and format, making your data simpler and faster to analyze. Timestream also automates rollups, retention, tiering, and compression of data, so you can manage your data at the lowest possible cost. Timestream is serverless, so there are no servers to manage. It manages time-consuming tasks such as server provisioning, software patching, setup, configuration, or data retention and tiering, freeing you to focus on building your applications.</p> <h3 id="amazon-documentdb-with-mongodb-compatibility"><a href="#amazon-documentdb-with-mongodb-compatibility" class="header-anchor">#</a> Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)</h3> <p>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads.</p> <p>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is designed from the ground-up to give you the performance, scalability, and availability you need when operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads at scale.

App Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications.</p> <p>Modern applications are often composed of multiple microservices that each perform a specific function. This architecture helps to increase the availability and scalability of the application by allowing each component to scale independently based on demand, and automatically degrading functionality when a component fails instead of going offline. Each microservice interacts with all the other microservices through an API. As the number of microservices grows within an application, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint the exact location of errors, re-route traffic after failures, and safely deploy code changes. Previously, this has required you to build monitoring and control logic directly into your code and redeploy your microservices every time there are changes.</p> <p>AWS App Mesh makes it easy to run microservices by providing consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application.

Each service interacts with a variety of other resources such as databases, queues, object stores, and customer-defined microservices, and they also need to be able to find the location of all the infrastructure resources on which it depends, in order to function. You typically manually manage all these resource names and their locations within the application code. However, manual resource management becomes time consuming and error-prone as the number of dependent infrastructure resources increases or the number of microservices dynamically scale up and down based on traffic. You can also use third-party service discovery products, but this requires installing and managing additional software and infrastructure.</p> <p>Cloud Map allows you to register any application resources such as databases, queues, microservices, and other cloud resources with custom names.

As you grow the number of workloads running on AWS, you need to be able to scale your networks across multiple accounts and Amazon VPCs to keep up with the growth. Today, you can connect pairs of Amazon VPCs using peering. However, managing point-to-point connectivity across many Amazon VPCs, without the ability to centrally manage the connectivity policies, can be operationally costly and cumbersome. For on-premises connectivity, you need to attach your AWS VPN to each individual Amazon VPC. This solution can be time consuming to build and hard to manage when the number of VPCs grows into the hundreds.</p> <p>With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway in to each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks which act like spokes. This hub and spoke model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only has to connect to the Transit Gateway and not to every other network. Any new VPC is simply connected to the Transit Gateway and is then automatically available to every other network that is connected to the Transit Gateway. This ease of connectivity makes it easy to scale your network as you grow.</p> <h3 id="aws-vpn"><a href="#aws-vpn" class="header-anchor">#</a> AWS VPN</h3> <div class="el-tabs el-tabs--top el-tabs--border-card"><div class="el-tabs__header is-top"><div class="el-tabs__nav-wrap is-top"><div class="el-tabs__nav-scroll"><div role="tablist" class="el-tabs__nav is-top" style="transform:translateX(-0px);"></div></div></div></div><div class="el-tabs__content"><div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p>AWS Client VPN is used by your remote workforce to securely access resources both on AWS and within your on-premises networks.</p> <p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/products/vpn/Product-Page-Diagram_AWS-Client-VPN-Connect%402x.59faa6ee9ab62c876ad232cd6a7a7566b6c4219b.png" alt="img"></p></div> <div role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" id="pane-null" aria-labelledby="tab-null" class="el-tab-pane" style="display:none;"><p>AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted connections between your locations (such as data centers and remote offices) and your AWS resources.</p> <p><img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/products/vpn/Product-Page-Diagram_Accelerated-Site-to-Site-VPN%402x%20(1)1.ec2d3da789b5a8b389e71f32073d7cba2dab293a.png" alt="img"></p></div></div></div> <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Virtual Private Network<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network.
