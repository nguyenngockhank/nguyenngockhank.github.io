In the text\nexample, all of the text interfaces are relatively simple.\nIs one interface more general-purpose than another?\nDoes one interface enable a more efficient implementation than\nanother? In the text example, the character-oriented approach is\nlikely to be significantly slower than the others, because it requires a\nseparate call into the text module for each character.\nOnce you have compared alternative designs, you will be in a better\nposition to identify the best design.

In order to eliminate the additional text manipulations, the\ntext interface needs to match more closely the operations happening in\nhigher level software.
