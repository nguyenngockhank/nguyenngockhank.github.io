I have discussed red flags\nthat can help you identify unnecessary complexity, such as information\nleakage, unneeded error conditions, or names that are too generic. I have\npresented some general ideas you can use to create simpler software\nsystems, such as striving for classes that are deep and generic, defining\nerrors out of existence, and separating interface documentation from\nimplementation documentation.
