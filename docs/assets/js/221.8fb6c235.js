This chapter showed a number of ways to break\n\nthem down so the reader can digest them piece by piece.\n\n**90** CHAPTER EIGHT\n\n\nOne simple technique is to introduce “explaining variables” that capture the value of some\n\nlarge subexpression. This approach has three benefits:\n\n- It breaks down a giant expression into pieces.\n- It documents the code by describing the subexpression with a succinct name.\n- It helps the reader identify the main “concepts” in the code.\n\nAnother technique is to manipulate your logic using De Morgan’s laws—this technique can\n\nsometimes rewrite a boolean expression in a cleaner way (e.g., if (!(a && !b)) turns into if\n\n(!a || b)).\n\nWe showed an example where a complex logical condition was broken down into tiny\n\nstatements like “if (a < b) ...”. In fact, _all_ of the improved-code examples in this chapter had\n\nif statements with no more than _two_ values inside them. This setup is ideal. It may not always\n\nseem possible to do this—sometimes it requires “negating” the problem or considering the\n\nopposite of your goal.\n\nFinally, even though this chapter is about breaking down individual expressions, these same\n\ntechniques often apply to larger blocks of code, too. So be aggressive in breaking down complex\n\nlogic wherever you see it.\n\n")])])]),a("p",[e._v("BREAKING DOWN GIANT EXPRESSIONS 91")]),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"language- extra-class"},[a("pre",{pre:!0,attrs:{class:"language-text"}},[a("code",[e._v("\n")])])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
