On the other hand, inconsistencies can be resolved in the background, and most of the time they will not be noticeable by the customer. Derived from this core principle, Dynamo is aggressively
optimized for availability.</p> <p>The Dynamo design was highly influential as it inspired many NoSQL databases, like <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassandra<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, <a href="https://riak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riak<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, and <a href="http://www.projectvoldemort.com/voldemort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voldemort<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> – not to mention Amazon’s own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DynamoDB<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <h3 id="design-goals"><a href="#design-goals" class="header-anchor">#</a> Design goals</h3> <p>As stated above, the main goal of Dynamo is to be highly available.

the summary of its other design goals:</p> <ul><li><strong>Scalable</strong>: The system should be <strong><em>highly scalable</em></strong>. We should be able to throw a machine into the system to see proportional improvement.</li> <li><strong>Decentralized</strong>: To avoid single points of failure and performance bottlenecks, there should not be any central/leader process.</li> <li><strong>Eventually Consistent</strong>: Data can be <strong><em>optimistically replicated</em></strong> to become eventually consistent. This means that instead of incurring write-time costs to ensure data correctness throughout the system (i.e., strong consistency), inconsistencies can be resolved at some other time (e.g., during reads). Eventual consistency is used to achieve high availability.</li></ul> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/hld.58698744.png" alt="High level design"></p> <h3 id="dynamo-s-use-cases"><a href="#dynamo-s-use-cases" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dynamo’s use cases</h3> <p>By default, Dynamo is an eventually consistent database. Therefore, any
application where strong consistency is not a concern can utilize Dynamo.
Though Dynamo can support strong consistency, it comes with a
performance impact. Hence, if strong consistency is a requirement for an
application, then Dynamo might not be a good option.</p> <p>Dynamo is used at Amazon to manage services that have very highreliability requirements and need tight control over the trade-offs between
<strong>availability</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, <strong>cost-effectiveness</strong>, and <strong>performance</strong>. Amazon’s
platform has a very diverse set of applications with different storage
requirements. Many applications chose Dynamo because of its flexibility for
selecting the appropriate trade-offs to achieve high availability and
guaranteed performance in the most cost-effective manner.</p> <p>Many services on Amazon’s platform require only primary-key access to a
data store. For such services, the common pattern of using a relational
database would lead to inefficiencies and limit scalability and availability.
Dynamo provides a simple primary-key only interface to meet the
requirements of these applications.</p> <h3 id="system-apis"><a href="#system-apis" class="header-anchor">#</a> System APIs</h3> <p>The Dynamo clients use <code>put()</code> and <code>get()</code> operations to write and read data
corresponding to a specified key. This key uniquely identifies an object.</p> <ul><li><code>get(key)</code> : The <code>get</code> operation finds the nodes where the object associated with the given key is located and returns either a single
object or a list of objects with conflicting versions along with a <em>context</em>. The <em>context</em> contains encoded metadata about the object that is meaningless to the caller and includes information such as the version of the object (more on this below).</li> <li><code>put(key, context, object)</code> : The <code>put</code> operation finds the nodes where the object associated with the given key should be stored and writes the given object to the disk. The context is a value that is returned with a <code>get</code> operation and then sent back with the <code>put</code> operation. The context is always stored along with the object and is used like a cookie to verify the validity of the object supplied in the put request.</li></ul> <p>Dynamo treats both the object and the key as an arbitrary array of bytes
(typically less than 1 MB). It applies the MD5 hashing algorithm on the key to
generate a 128-bit identifier which is used to determine the storage nodes
that are responsible for serving the key.</p> <h2 id="high-level-architecture"><a href="#high-level-architecture" class="header-anchor">#</a> High-level Architecture</h2> <p>At a high level, Dynamo is a <strong>Distributed Hash Table</strong> (DHT) that is replicated across the cluster for high availability and fault tolerance.</p> <h3 id="data-distribution"><a href="#data-distribution" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data distribution</h3> <p>Dynamo uses <strong>Consistent Hashing</strong> to distribute its data among nodes.

There are two challenges when we try to distribute data:</p> <ol><li>How do we know on which node a particular piece of data will be stored?</li> <li>When we add or remove nodes, how do we know what data will be moved from existing nodes to the new nodes? Furthermore, how can we minimize data movement when nodes join or leave?</li></ol> <h3 id="consistent-hashing-dynamo-s-data-distribution"><a href="#consistent-hashing-dynamo-s-data-distribution" class="header-anchor">#</a> Consistent hashing: Dynamo’s data distribution</h3> <p>Consistent hashing represents the data managed by a cluster as a ring. Each node in the ring is assigned a range of data. Dynamo uses the consistent hashing algorithm to determine what row is stored to what node. Here is an example of the consistent hashing ring:</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/consitenthash.1c254622.png" alt="rign"></p> <p>With consistent hashing, the ring is divided into smaller predefined ranges.</p> <p>Each node is assigned one of these ranges. In Dynamo’s terminology, the start  of the range is called a token. This means that each node will be assigned one token. The range assigned to each node is computed as follows:</p> <ul><li><strong>Range start</strong>:  Token value</li> <li><strong>Range end</strong>:    Next token value - 1</li></ul> <p>Here are the tokens and data ranges of the four nodes described in the above
diagram:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Server</th> <th>Token</th> <th>Range Start</th> <th>Range End</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Server 1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>25</td></tr> <tr><td>Server 2</td> <td>26</td> <td>26</td> <td>50</td></tr> <tr><td>Server 3</td> <td>51</td> <td>51</td> <td>75</td></tr> <tr><td>Server 4</td> <td>76</td> <td>76</td> <td>100</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Whenever Dynamo is serving a <code>put()</code> or a <code>get()</code> request, the first step it performs is to apply the <strong>MD5 hashing algorithm</strong> to the key. The output of this hashing algorithm determines within which range the data lies and hence,
on which node the data will be stored. As we saw above, each node in Dynamo is supposed to store data for a fixed range. Hence, the hash generated from the data key tells us the node where the data will be stored.</p> <h3 id="virtual-nodes"><a href="#virtual-nodes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Virtual nodes</h3> <p>Adding and removing nodes in any distributed system is quite common.
Existing nodes can die and may need to be decommissioned. Similarly, new
nodes may be added to an existing cluster to meet growing demands.
Dynamo efficiently handles these scenarios through the use of virtual nodes
(or Vnodes).</p> <p>As we saw above, the basic Consistent Hashing algorithm assigns a single
token (or a consecutive hash range) to each physical node. This was a static
division of ranges that requires calculating tokens based on a given number
of nodes. This scheme made adding or replacing a node an expensive
operation, as, in this case, we would like to rebalance and distribute the data
to all other nodes, resulting in moving a lot of data. Here are a few potential
issues associated with a manual and fixed division of the ranges:</p> <ul><li><strong>Adding or removing nodes</strong>: Adding or removing nodes will result in recomputing the tokens causing a significant administrative overhead for a large cluster.</li> <li><strong>Hotspots</strong>: Since each node is assigned one large range, if the data is not  evenly distributed, some nodes can become hotspots.</li> <li><strong>Node rebuilding</strong>: Since each node’s data is replicated on a <em>fixed number of nodes</em>, when we need to rebuild a node, only its replica nodes can provide the data. This puts a lot of pressure on the replica nodes and can lead to service degradation.</li></ul> <p>To handle these issues, Dynamo introduced a new scheme for distributing
the tokens to physical nodes. Instead of assigning a single token to a node,
the hash range is divided into multiple smaller ranges, and each physical
node is assigned multiple of these smaller ranges. Each of these subranges is
called a Vnode. With Vnodes, instead of a node being responsible for just one
token, it is responsible for many tokens (or subranges).</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/vnodes.58aaac1a.png" alt="vnodes"></p> <p>Practically, Vnodes are <strong>randomly distributed</strong> across the cluster and are generally <strong>non-contiguous</strong> so that no two neighboring Vnodes are assigned to the same physical node. Furthermore, nodes do carry replicas of other nodes for fault-tolerance. Also, since there can be heterogeneous machines in the clusters, some servers might hold more Vnodes than others. The figure below shows how physical nodes A, B, C, D, &amp; E are using Vnodes of the Consistent Hash ring. Each physical node is assigned a set of Vnodes and each Vnode is replicated once.</p> <h3 id="advantages-of-vnodes"><a href="#advantages-of-vnodes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advantages of Vnodes</h3> <ol><li><p>Vnodes help <strong>spread the load more evenly</strong> across the physical nodes on the cluster by dividing the hash ranges into smaller subranges. This speeds up the rebalancing process after adding or removing nodes.
When a new node is added, it receives many Vnodes from the existing
nodes to maintain a balanced cluster. Similarly, when a node needs to
be rebuilt, instead of getting data from a fixed number of replicas, many
nodes participate in the rebuild process.</p></li> <li><p>Vnodes make it easier to <strong>maintain a cluster containing heterogeneous machines</strong>. This means, with Vnodes, we can assign a high number of ranges to a powerful server and a lower number of
ranges to a less powerful server.</p></li> <li><p>Since Vnodes help assign smaller ranges to each physical node, the <strong>probability of hotspots is much less</strong> than the basic Consistent Hashing scheme which uses one big range per node.</p></li></ol> <h2 id="replication"><a href="#replication" class="header-anchor">#</a> Replication</h2> <h3 id="optimistic-replication"><a href="#optimistic-replication" class="header-anchor">#</a> Optimistic replication?</h3> <p>To ensure high availability and durability, Dynamo replicates each data item
on multiple N nodes in the system where the value N is equivalent to the
<em>replication factor</em> and is configurable per instance of Dynamo. Each key is
assigned to a <strong>coordinator node</strong> (the node that falls first in the hash range),
which first stores the data locally and then replicates it to N − 1 clockwise
successor nodes on the ring. This results in each node owning the region on
the ring between it and its Nth predecessor. This replication is done
asynchronously (in the background), and Dynamo provides an <strong>eventually consistent</strong> model. This replication technique is called <strong>optimistic replication</strong>, which means that replicas are not guaranteed to be identical at
all times.</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/replica.115daa6f.png" alt="replica"></p> <p>Each node in Dynamo serves as a replica for a different range of data. As Dynamo stores N copies of data spread across different nodes, if one node is down, other replicas can respond to queries for that range of data. If a client
cannot contact the coordinator node, it sends the request to a node holding a replica.</p> <h3 id="preference-list"><a href="#preference-list" class="header-anchor">#</a> Preference List</h3> <p>The list of nodes responsible for storing a particular key is called the
preference list. Dynamo is designed so that every node in the system can
determine which nodes should be in this list for any specific key. This list contains more than N nodes to account for failure and skip
virtual nodes on the ring so that the list only contains distinct physical nodes.</p> <h3 id="sloppy-quorum-and-handling-of-temporary-failures"><a href="#sloppy-quorum-and-handling-of-temporary-failures" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sloppy quorum and handling of temporary failures</h3> <p>Following traditional quorum approaches, any distributed system becomes unavailable during server failures or network partitions and would have reduced availability even under simple failure conditions. To increase the
availability, Dynamo does not enforce strict quorum requirements, and
instead uses something called <strong>sloppy quorum</strong>. With this approach, all read/write operations are performed on the first N healthy nodes from the preference list, which may not always be the first N nodes encountered
while moving clockwise on the consistent hashing ring.</p> <h4 id="example"><a href="#example" class="header-anchor">#</a> Example</h4> <p>Consider the example of Dynamo configuration given in the figure below with <strong>N = 3</strong>.</p> <p>In this example, if <code>Server 1</code> is temporarily down or unreachable during a write operation, its data will now be stored on <code>Server 4</code> . Thus, Dynamo transfers the replica stored on the failing node (i.e., <code>Server 1</code> ) to the next node of the consistent hash ring that does not have the replica (i.e., <code>Server 4</code>).</p> <p>This is done to avoid unavailability caused by a short-term machine or network failure and to maintain desired availability and durability guarantees.</p> <p>The replica sent to <code>Server 4</code> will have a hint in its metadata that suggests which node was the intended recipient of the replica (in this case, <code>Server 1</code> ).</p> <p>Nodes that receive hinted replicas will keep them in a separate local database that is scanned periodically. Upon detecting that <code>Server 1</code> has recovered, <code>Server 4</code> will attempt to deliver the replica to <code>Server 1</code> .</p> <p>Once the transfer succeeds, <code>Server 4</code> may delete the object from its local store without decreasing the total number of replicas in the system.</p> <h3 id="hinted-handoff"><a href="#hinted-handoff" class="header-anchor">#</a> Hinted handoff</h3> <p>The interesting trick described above to increase availability is known as
hinted handoff, i.e., <strong>when a node is unreachable, another node can accept writes on its behalf</strong>. The write is then kept in a local buffer and sent out once the destination node is reachable again. This makes Dynamo <strong>always writeable.</strong>. Thus, even in the extreme case where only a single node is alive, write requests will still get accepted and eventually processed.</p> <p>The main problem is that since a sloppy quorum is not a strict majority, the data can and will diverge, i.e., it is possible for two concurrent writes to the same key to be accepted by non-overlapping sets of nodes. This means that multiple conflicting values against the same key can exist in the system, and we can get stale or conflicting data while reading. Dynamo allows this and resolves these conflicts using Vector Clocks.</p> <h2 id="vector-clocks-and-conicting-data"><a href="#vector-clocks-and-conicting-data" class="header-anchor">#</a> Vector Clocks and Conicting Data</h2> <h3 id="clock-skew"><a href="#clock-skew" class="header-anchor">#</a> Clock Skew</h3> <p>On a single machine, all we need to know about is the absolute or wall clock time: suppose we perform a write to key <code>k</code> with timestamp <code>t1</code> and then perform another write to <code>k</code> with timestamp <code>t2</code> . Since <code>t2 &gt; t1</code> , the second write must have been newer than the first write, and therefore the database can safely overwrite the original value.</p> <p>In a distributed system, this assumption does not hold. The problem is <strong>clock skew</strong>, i.e., different clocks tend to run at different rates, so we cannot assume that time <code>t</code> on node a happened before time <code>t + 1</code> on node b . The most practical techniques that help with synchronizing clocks, like NTP, still
do not guarantee that every clock in a distributed system is synchronized at
all times. So, without special hardware like GPS units and atomic clocks, just
using wall clock timestamps is not enough.</p> <h3 id="vector-clock"><a href="#vector-clock" class="header-anchor">#</a> Vector Clock</h3> <p>Instead of employing tight synchronization mechanics, Dynamo uses
something called <strong>vector clock</strong> in order to capture <strong>causality between different versions of the same object</strong>. A vector clock is effectively a <code>(node, counter)</code> pair. One vector clock is associated with every version of every object stored in Dynamo. One can determine whether two versions of an object are on parallel branches or have a causal ordering by examining their vector clocks. If the counters on the first object’s clock are less-than-or-equal to all of the nodes in the second clock, then the first is an ancestor of the second and can be forgotten. Otherwise, the two changes are considered to
be in conflict and require reconciliation. Dynamo resolves these conflicts at read-time. Let’s understands this with an example:</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/vector-clock.cac189dd.png" alt="img"></p> <ol><li>Server A serves a write to key <code>k1</code> , with value <code>foo</code> . It assigns it a version of <code>[A:1]</code>. This write gets replicated to server B .</li> <li>Server A serves a write to key <code>k1</code> , with value <code>bar</code> . It assigns it a version of <code>[A:2]</code>. This write also gets replicated to server B .</li> <li>A network partition occurs. A and B cannot talk to each other.</li> <li>Server A serves a write to key <code>k1</code> , with value <code>baz</code> . It assigns it a version of <code>[A:3]</code>. It cannot replicate it to server B , but it gets stored in a hinted handoff buffer on another server.</li> <li>Server B sees a write to key <code>k1</code> , with value <code>bax</code> . It assigns it a version of <code>[B:1]</code>. It cannot replicate it to server A , but it gets stored in a hinted handoff buffer on another server.</li> <li>The network heals. Server A and B can talk to each other again.</li> <li>Either server gets a read request for key <code>k1</code> . It sees the same key with different versions <code>[A:3]</code> and <code>[A:2]</code> <code>[B:1]</code> , but it does not know which one is newer. It returns both and tells the client to figure out the version and write the newer version back into the system.</li></ol> <p>As we saw in the above example, most of the time, new versions subsume the previous version(s), and the system itself can determine the correct version (e.g., <code>[A:2]</code> is newer than <code>[A:1]</code> ). However, version branching may happen in the presence of failures combined with concurrent updates, resulting in conflicting versions of an object. In these cases, the system
cannot reconcile the multiple versions of the same object, and the client must perform the reconciliation to collapse multiple branches of data evolution back into one (this process is called semantic reconciliation). A typical example of a collapse operation is “merging” different versions of a customer’s shopping cart. Using this reconciliation mechanism, an add operation (i.e., adding an item to the cart) is never lost. However, deleted items can resurface.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Resolving conflicts is similar to how Git works. If Git can merge different versions into one, merging is done automatically. If not, the client (i.e., the developer) has to reconcile conflicts manually.</p></div> <p>Dynamo truncates vector clocks (<em>oldest first</em>) when they grow too large. If Dynamo ends up deleting older vector clocks that are required to reconcile an object’s state, Dynamo would not be able to achieve eventual consistency. Dynamo’s authors note that this is a potential problem but do not specify how this may be addressed. They do mention that this problem has not yet
surfaced in any of their production systems.</p> <h3 id="conflict-free-replicated-data-types-crdts"><a href="#conflict-free-replicated-data-types-crdts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)</h3> <p>A more straightforward way to handle conflicts is through the use of <strong>CRDTs</strong>. To make use of CRDTs, we need to model our data in such a way that concurrent changes can be applied to the data in any order and will produce the same end result. This way, the system does not need to worry about any ordering guarantees. Amazon’s shopping cart is an excellent example of
CRDT. When a user adds two items (A &amp; B) to the cart, these two operations of adding A &amp; B can be done on any node and with any order, as the end result is the two items are added to the cart. (<em>Removing from the shopping cart is modeled as a negative add</em>). The idea that any two nodes that have received the same set of updates will see the same end result is called strong <strong>eventual consistency</strong>. <strong>Riak</strong> has a few built-in <a href="https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/2.2.0/developing/data-types/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRDTs<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <h3 id="last-write-wins-lww"><a href="#last-write-wins-lww" class="header-anchor">#</a> Last-write-wins (LWW)</h3> <p>Unfortunately, it is not easy to model the data as CRDTs. In many cases, it
involves too much effort. Therefore, vector clocks with client-side resolution
are considered good enough.</p> <p>Instead of vector clocks, Dynamo also offers ways to resolve the conflicts
automatically on the server-side. Dynamo (and Apache Cassandra) often uses
a simple conflict resolution policy: <strong>last-write-wins (LWW)</strong>, based on the
wall-clock timestamp. LWW can easily end up losing data. For example, if
two conflicting writes happen simultaneously, it is equivalent to flipping a
coin on which write to throw away.</p> <h2 id="the-life-of-put-get-operations"><a href="#the-life-of-put-get-operations" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Life of put() &amp; get() Operations</h2> <h3 id="strategies-for-choosing-the-coordinator-node"><a href="#strategies-for-choosing-the-coordinator-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> Strategies for choosing the coordinator node</h3> <p>Dynamo clients can use one of the two strategies to choose a node for their get() and put() requests:</p> <ul><li>Clients can route their requests through a generic load balancer.</li> <li>Clients can use a partition-aware client library that routes the requests to the appropriate coordinator nodes with lower latency</li></ul> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/coordinator.f74175bd.png" alt="img"></p> <p>In the first case, the load balancer decides which way the request would be
routed, while in the second strategy, the client selects the node to contact.
Both approaches are beneficial in their own ways.</p> <p>In the first strategy, the client is unaware of the Dynamo ring, which helps scalability and makes Dynamo’s architecture <strong>loosely coupled</strong>. However, in this case, since the load balancer can forward the request to any node in the
ring, it is possible that the node it selects is not part of the preference list.
This will result in an extra hop, as the request will then be forwarded to one of the nodes in the preference list by the intermediate node.</p> <p>The second strategy helps in achieving <strong>lower latency</strong>, as in this case, the
client maintains a copy of the ring and forwards the request to an
appropriate node from the preference list. Because of this option, Dynamo is
also called a <strong>zero-hop DHT</strong>, as the client can directly contact the node that
holds the required data. However, in this case, Dynamo does not have much
control over the load distribution and request handling</p> <h3 id="consistency-protocol"><a href="#consistency-protocol" class="header-anchor">#</a> Consistency protocol</h3> <p>Dynamo uses a consistency protocol similar to quorum systems. If R/W is the minimum number of nodes that must participate in a successful read/write operation respectively:</p> <ul><li>Then <code>R + W &gt; N</code> yields a quorum-like system</li> <li>A Common (N, R, W) configuration used by Dynamo is (3, 2, 2).
<ul><li>(3, 3, 1): fast W, slow R, not very durable</li> <li>(3, 1, 3): fast R, slow W, durable</li></ul></li> <li>In this model, the latency of a get() (or put() ) operation depends upon the slowest of the replicas. For this reason, R and W are usually configured to be less than N to provide better latency.</li> <li>In general, low values of W and R increase the risk of inconsistency, as write requests are deemed successful and returned to the clients even if a majority of replicas have not processed them. This also introduces a vulnerability window for durability when a write request is successfully returned to the client even though it has been persisted at only a small number of nodes.</li> <li>For both Read and Write operations, the requests are forwarded to the first ‘N’ healthy nodes.</li></ul> <h3 id="put-process"><a href="#put-process" class="header-anchor">#</a> ‘put()’ process</h3> <ol><li>The coordinator generates a new data version and vector clock component.</li> <li>Saves new data locally.</li> <li>Sends the write request to <code>N − 1</code> highest-ranked healthy nodes from the preference list.</li> <li>The put() operation is considered successful after receiving <code>W − 1</code> confirmation.</li></ol> <h3 id="get-process"><a href="#get-process" class="header-anchor">#</a> ‘get()’ process</h3> <ol><li>The coordinator requests the data version from <code>N − 1</code> highest-ranked healthy nodes from the preference list.</li> <li>Waits until <code>R − 1</code> replies.</li> <li>Coordinator handles causal data versions through a vector clock.</li> <li>Returns all relevant data versions to the caller.</li></ol> <h3 id="request-handling-through-state-machine"><a href="#request-handling-through-state-machine" class="header-anchor">#</a> Request handling through state machine</h3> <p>Each client request results in creating a state machine on the node that
received the client request. The state machine contains all the logic for
identifying the nodes responsible for a key, sending the requests, waiting for
responses, potentially doing retries, processing the replies, and packaging
the response for the client. Each state machine instance handles exactly one
client request. For example, a read operation implements the following state
machine:</p> <ol><li>Send read requests to the nodes.</li> <li>Wait for the minimum number of required responses.</li> <li>If too few replies were received within a given time limit, fail the request.</li> <li>Otherwise, gather all the data versions and determine the ones to be returned.</li> <li>If versioning is enabled, perform syntactic reconciliation and generate an opaque write context that contains the vector clock that subsumes all the remaining versions</li></ol> <p>After the read response has been returned to the caller, the state machine waits for a short period to receive any outstanding responses. If stale versions were returned in any of the responses, the coordinator updates those nodes with the latest version. This process is called <strong>Read Repair</strong> because it repairs replicas that have missed a recent update.</p> <p>As stated above, put() requests are coordinated by one of the top N nodes
in the preference list. Although it is always desirable to have the first node
among the top N to coordinate the writes, thereby serializing all writes at a
single location, this approach has led to uneven load distribution for
Dynamo. This is because the request load is not uniformly distributed across
objects. To counter this, any of the top N nodes in the preference list is
allowed to coordinate the writes. In particular, since each write operation
usually follows a read operation, the coordinator for a write operation is
chosen to be the node that replied fastest to the previous read operation,
which is stored in the request’s context information. This optimization
enables Dynamo to pick the node that has the data that was read by the
preceding read operation, thereby increasing the chances of getting “<strong>read-your-writes”</strong> consistency.</p> <h2 id="anti-entropy-through-merkle-trees"><a href="#anti-entropy-through-merkle-trees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Anti-entropy Through Merkle Trees</h2> <p>As we know, Dynamo uses vector clocks to remove conflicts while serving
read requests. Now, if a replica falls significantly behind others, it might take
a very long time to resolve conflicts using just vector clocks. It would be nice
to be able to automatically resolve some conflicts in the background. To do
this, we need to quickly compare two copies of a range of data residing on
different replicas and figure out exactly which parts are different.</p> <h3 id="merkle-trees"><a href="#merkle-trees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Merkle trees</h3> <p>A replica can contain a lot of data. Naively splitting up the entire data range
for checksums is not very feasible; there is simply too much data to be
transferred. Therefore, Dynamo uses <strong>Merkle trees</strong> to compare replicas of a
range. A Merkle tree is a binary tree of hashes, where each internal node is
the hash of its two children, and each leaf node is a hash of a portion of the
original data.</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/merkle-tree.4ed2fcad.png" alt="img"></p> <p>Comparing Merkle trees is conceptually simple:</p> <ol><li>Compare the root hashes of both trees.</li> <li>If they are equal, stop.</li> <li>Recurse on the left and right children.</li></ol> <p>Ultimately, this means that replicas know precisely which parts of the range
are different, and the amount of data exchanged is minimized.</p> <h3 id="merits-and-demerits-of-merkle-trees"><a href="#merits-and-demerits-of-merkle-trees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Merits and demerits of Merkle trees</h3> <p>The principal advantage of using a Merkle tree is that each branch of the tree
can be checked independently without requiring nodes to download the
entire tree or the whole data set. Hence, Merkle trees minimize the amount
of data that needs to be transferred for synchronization and reduce the
number of disk reads performed during the anti-entropy process.</p> <p>The disadvantage of using Merkle trees is that many key ranges can change
when a node joins or leaves, and as a result, the trees need to be
recalculated.</p> <h2 id="gossip-protocol"><a href="#gossip-protocol" class="header-anchor">#</a> Gossip Protocol</h2> <p>In a Dynamo cluster, since we do not have any central node that keeps track
of all nodes to know if a node is down or not, how does a node know every
other node’s current state? The simplest way to do this is to have every node
maintain heartbeats with every other node. When a node goes down, it will
stop sending out heartbeats, and everyone else will find out immediately. But
then O(N<sup>2</sup>) messages get sent every tick (N being the number of nodes),
which is a ridiculously high amount and not feasible in any sizable cluster.</p> <p>Dynamo uses <strong>gossip protocol</strong> that enables each node to keep track of state
information about the other nodes in the cluster, like which nodes are
reachable, what key ranges they are responsible for, and so on (this is
basically a copy of the hash ring). Nodes share state information with each
other to stay in sync. Gossip protocol is a <strong>peer-to-peer communication mechanism</strong> in which nodes periodically exchange state information about
themselves and other nodes they know about. Each node initiates a gossip
round every second to exchange state information about itself and other nodes with one other random node. This means that any new event will
eventually propagate through the system, and all nodes quickly learn about
all other nodes in a cluster.</p> <p><img src="/docs/assets/img/gossip.45461107.png" alt="img"></p> <h3 id="external-discovery-through-seed-nodes"><a href="#external-discovery-through-seed-nodes" class="header-anchor">#</a> External discovery through seed nodes</h3> <p>As we know, Dynamo nodes use gossip protocol to find the current state of
the ring. This can result in a logical partition of the cluster in a particular
scenario. Let’s understand this with an example:</p> <p>An administrator joins node A to the ring and then joins node B to the ring.
Nodes A and B consider themselves part of the ring, yet neither would be
immediately aware of each other. To prevent these logical partitions,
Dynamo introduced the concept of <strong>seed nodes</strong>. Seed nodes are fully
functional nodes and can be obtained either from a static configuration or a
configuration service. This way, all nodes are aware of seed nodes. Each
node communicates with seed nodes through gossip protocol to reconcile
membership changes; therefore, logical partitions are highly unlikely.</p> <h2 id="dynamo-characteristics-and-criticism"><a href="#dynamo-characteristics-and-criticism" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dynamo Characteristics and Criticism</h2> <h3 id="responsibilities-of-a-dynamo-s-node"><a href="#responsibilities-of-a-dynamo-s-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> Responsibilities of a Dynamo’s node</h3> <p>Because Dynamo is completely decentralized and does not rely on a central/leader server (unlike GFS, for example), each node serves three functions:</p> <ol><li><strong>Managing get() and put() requests</strong>: A node may act as a coordinator and manage all operations for a particular key or may forward the request to the appropriate node.</li> <li><strong>Keeping track of membership and detecting failures</strong>: Every node uses gossip protocol to keep track of other nodes in the system and their associated hash ranges.</li> <li><strong>Local persistent storage</strong>: Each node is responsible for being either the primary or replica store for keys that hash to a specific range of values.

This is likely to affect the scalability of the system as this routing table will grow larger and larger as nodes are added to the system.</li> <li>Dynamo seems to imply that it strives for symmetry, where every node in the system has the same set of roles and responsibilities, but later, it specifies some nodes as seeds. Seeds are special nodes that are externally discoverable. These are used to help prevent logical partitions in the Dynamo ring. This seems like it may violate Dynamo’s symmetry principle.</li> <li>Although security was not a concern as Dynamo was built for internal use only, DHTs can be susceptible to several different types of attacks. While Amazon can assume a trusted environment, sometimes a buggy software can act in a manner quite similar to a malicious actor.</li> <li>Dynamo’s design can be described as a “leaky abstraction,” where client applications are often asked to manage inconsistency, and the user experience is not 100% seamless.
