Martin Series</strong></p> <p>The mission of this series is to improve the state of the art of software craftsmanship.
The books in this series are technical, pragmatic, and substantial. The authors are</p> <p>highly experienced craftsmen and professionals dedicated to writing about what
actually works in practice, as opposed to what might work in theory. You will read
about what the author has done, not what he thinks you should do. If the book is
about programming, there will be lots of code. If the book is about managing, there
will be lots of case studies from real projects.</p> <p>These are the books that all serious practitioners will have on their bookshelves.
These are the books that will be remembered for making a difference and for guiding
professionals to become true craftsman.</p> <p><em>Managing Agile Projects</em>

perfect complement to our damp and often chilly weather. Part of the charm of Ga-Jol to
us Danes is the wise or witty sayings printed on the flap of every box top. I bought a two-
pack of the delicacy this morning and found that it bore this old Danish saw:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Ærlighed i små ting er ikke nogen lille ting.
</code></pre></div><p>“Honesty in small things is not a small thing.” It was a good omen consistent with what I
already wanted to say here. Small things matter. This is a book about humble concerns
whose value is nonetheless far from small.</p> <p><em>God is in the details</em> , said the architect Ludwig mies van der Rohe. This quote recalls
contemporary arguments about the role of architecture in software development, and par-
ticularly in the Agile world. Bob and I occasionally find ourselves passionately engaged in
this dialogue. And yes, mies van der Rohe was attentive to utility and to the timeless forms
of building that underlie great architecture. On the other hand, he also personally selected
every doorknob for every house he designed. Why? Because small things matter.</p> <p>In our ongoing “debate” on TDD, Bob and I have discovered that we agree that soft-
ware architecture has an important place in development, though we likely have different
visions of exactly what that means. Such quibbles are relatively unimportant, however,
because we can accept for granted that responsible professionals give <em>some</em> time to think-
ing and planning at the outset of a project. The late-1990s notions of design driven <em>only</em> by
the tests and the code are long gone. Yet attentiveness to detail is an even more critical
foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision. First, it is through practice in the
small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large. Second, the
smallest bit of sloppy construction, of the door that does not close tightly or the slightly
crooked tile on the floor, or even the messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the
larger whole. That is what clean code is about.</p> <p>Still, architecture is just one metaphor for software development, and in particular for
that part of software that delivers the initial <em>product</em> in the same sense that an architect
delivers a pristine building. In these days of Scrum and Agile, the focus is on quickly
bringing <em>product</em> to market. We want the factory running at top speed to produce software.
These are human factories: thinking, feeling coders who are working from a product back-
log or user story to create <em>product</em>. The manufacturing metaphor looms ever strong in such
thinking. The production aspects of Japanese auto manufacturing, of an assembly-line
world, inspire much of Scrum.</p> <p>xx <strong>Foreword</strong></p> <p>Yet even in the auto industry, the bulk of the work lies not in manufacturing but in
maintenance—or its avoidance. In software, 80% or more of what we do is quaintly called
“maintenance”: the act of repair. Rather than embracing the typical Western focus on <em>pro-
ducing</em> good software, we should be thinking more like home repairmen in the building
industry, or auto mechanics in the automotive field. What does Japanese management have
to say about <em>that</em>?</p> <p>In about 1951, a quality approach called Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) came
on the Japanese scene. Its focus is on maintenance rather than on production. One of the
major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S principles. 5S is a set of disciplines—and
here I use the term “discipline” instructively. These 5S principles are in fact at the founda-
tions of Lean—another buzzword on the Western scene, and an increasingly prominent
buzzword in software circles. These principles are not an option. As Uncle Bob relates in
his front matter, good software practice requires such discipline: focus, presence of mind,
and thinking. It is not always just about doing, about pushing the factory equipment to pro-
duce at the optimal velocity. The 5S philosophy comprises these concepts:</p> <p><strong>-</strong> <em>Seiri</em> , or organization (think “sort” in English). Knowing where things are—using
approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial. You think naming identifiers isn’t
important? Read on in the following chapters.
<strong>-</strong> <em>Seiton</em> , or tidiness (think “systematize” in English). There is an old American saying:
<em>A place for everything, and everything in its place</em>. A piece of code should be where
you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.
<strong>-</strong> <em>Seiso</em> , or cleaning (think “shine” in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging
wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your
code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for
the future? Get rid of them.
<strong>-</strong> <em>Seiketsu</em> , or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.
Do you think this book says anything about having a consistent coding style and set of
practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on.
<strong>-</strong> <em>Shutsuke</em> , or discipline ( <em>self</em> -discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the
practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.
If you take up the challenge—yes, the challenge—of reading and applying this book,
you’ll come to understand and appreciate the last point. Here, we are finally driving to the
roots of responsible professionalism in a profession that should be concerned with the life
cycle of a product. As we maintain automobiles and other machines under TPM, break-
down maintenance—waiting for bugs to surface—is the exception. Instead, we go up a
level: inspect the machines every day and fix wearing parts before they break, or do the
equivalent of the proverbial 10,000-mile oil change to forestall wear and tear. In code,
refactor mercilessly. You can improve yet one level further, as the TPM movement inno-
vated over 50 years ago: build machines that are more maintainable in the first place. Mak-
ing your code readable is as important as making it executable. The ultimate practice,
introduced in TPM circles around 1960, is to focus on introducing entire new machines or</p> <p><strong>Foreword</strong> xxi</p> <p>replacing old ones. As Fred Brooks admonishes us, we should probably re-do major soft-
ware chunks from scratch every seven years or so to sweep away creeping cruft. Perhaps
we should update Brooks’ time constant to an order of weeks, days or hours instead of
years. That’s where detail lies.</p> <p>There is great power in detail, yet there is something humble and profound about this
approach to life, as we might stereotypically expect from any approach that claims Japa-
nese roots. But this is not only an Eastern outlook on life; English and American folk wis-
dom are full of such admonishments. The Seiton quote from above flowed from the pen of
an Ohio minister who literally viewed neatness “as a remedy for every degree of evil.”
How about Seiso? <em>Cleanliness is next to godliness</em>. As beautiful as a house is, a messy
desk robs it of its splendor. How about Shutsuke in these small matters? <em>He who is faithful
in little is faithful in much</em>. How about being eager to re-factor at the responsible time,
strengthening one’s position for subsequent “big” decisions, rather than putting it off? <em>A
stitch in time saves nine</em>. <em>The early bird catches the worm. Don’t put off until tomorrow
what you can do today.</em> (Such was the original sense of the phrase “the last responsible
moment” in Lean until it fell into the hands of software consultants_._ ) How about calibrat-
ing the place of small, individual efforts in a grand whole? <em>Mighty oaks from little acorns
grow.</em> Or how about integrating simple preventive work into everyday life? <em>An ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</em> Clean code
honors the deep roots of wisdom beneath our broader culture, or our culture as it once was,
or should be, and <em>can</em> be with attentiveness to detail.</p> <p>Even in the grand architectural literature we find saws that hark back to these sup-
posed details. Think of mies van der Rohe’s doorknobs. That’s <em>seiri</em>. That’s being attentive
to every variable name. You should name a variable using the same care with which you
name a first-born child.</p> <p>As every homeowner knows, such care and ongoing refinement never come to an end.
The architect Christopher Alexander—father of patterns and pattern languages—views
every act of design itself as a small, local act of repair. And he views the craftsmanship of
fine structure to be the sole purview of the architect; the larger forms can be left to patterns
and their application by the inhabitants. Design is ever ongoing not only as we add a new
room to a house, but as we are attentive to repainting, replacing worn carpets, or upgrad-
ing the kitchen sink. Most arts echo analogous sentiments. In our search for others who
ascribe God’s home as being in the details, we find ourselves in the good company of the
19th century French author Gustav Flaubert. The French poet Paul Valery advises us that a
poem is never done and bears continual rework, and to stop working on it is abandonment.
Such preoccupation with detail is common to all endeavors of excellence. So maybe there
is little new here, but in reading this book you will be challenged to take up good disci-
plines that you long ago surrendered to apathy or a desire for spontaneity and just
“responding to change.”</p> <p>Unfortunately, we usually don’t view such concerns as key cornerstones of the art of
programming. We abandon our code early, not because it is done, but because our value
system focuses more on outward appearance than on the substance of what we deliver.</p> <p>xxii <strong>Foreword</strong></p> <p>This inattentiveness costs us in the end: <em>A bad penny always shows up</em>. Research, neither in
industry nor in academia, humbles itself to the lowly station of keeping code clean. Back
in my days working in the Bell Labs Software Production Research organization ( <em>Produc-
tion</em> , indeed!) we had some back-of-the-envelope findings that suggested that consistent
indentation style was one of the most statistically significant indicators of low bug density.
We want it to be that architecture or programming language or some other high notion
should be the cause of quality; as people whose supposed professionalism owes to the
mastery of tools and lofty design methods, we feel insulted by the value that those factory-
floor machines, the coders, add through the simple consistent application of an indentation
style. To quote my own book of 17 years ago, such style distinguishes excellence from
mere competence. The Japanese worldview understands the crucial value of the everyday
worker and, more so, of the systems of development that owe to the simple, everyday
actions of those workers. Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care—not just of
any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are simple doesn’t mean
that they are simplistic, and it hardly means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the
fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty, in any human endeavor. To ignore them is not
yet to be fully human.</p> <p>Of course, I am still an advocate of thinking at broader scope, and particularly of the
value of architectural approaches rooted in deep domain knowledge and software usability.
The book isn’t about that—or, at least, it isn’t obviously about that. This book has a subtler
message whose profoundness should not be underappreciated. It fits with the current saw
of the really code-based people like Peter Sommerlad, Kevlin Henney and Giovanni
Asproni. “The code is the design” and “Simple code” are their mantras. While we must
take care to remember that the interface is the program, and that its structures have much
to say about our program structure, it is crucial to continuously adopt the humble stance
that the design lives in the code. And while rework in the manufacturing metaphor leads to
cost, rework in design leads to value. We should view our code as the beautiful articulation
of noble efforts of design—design as a process, not a static endpoint. It’s in the code that
the architectural metrics of coupling and cohesion play out. If you listen to Larry Constan-
tine describe coupling and cohesion, he speaks in terms of code—not lofty abstract con-
cepts that one might find in UML. Richard Gabriel advises us in his essay, “Abstraction
Descant” that abstraction is evil. Code is anti-evil, and clean code is perhaps divine.</p> <p>Going back to my little box of Ga-Jol, I think it’s important to note that the Danish
wisdom advises us not just to pay attention to small things, but also to be <em>honest</em> in small
things. This means being honest to the code, honest to our colleagues about the state of our
code and, most of all, being honest with ourselves about our code. Did we Do our Best to
“leave the campground cleaner than we found it”? Did we re-factor our code before check-
ing in? These are not peripheral concerns but concerns that lie squarely in the center of
Agile values. It is a recommended practice in Scrum that re-factoring be part of the con-
cept of “Done.” Neither architecture nor clean code insist on perfection, only on honesty
and doing the best we can. <em>To err is human; to forgive, divine.</em> In Scrum, we make every-
thing visible. We air our dirty laundry. We are honest about the state of our code because</p> <p><strong>Foreword</strong> xxiii</p> <p>code is never perfect. We become more fully human, more worthy of the divine, and closer
to that greatness in the details.</p> <p>In our profession, we desperately need all the help we can get. If a clean shop floor
reduces accidents, and well-organized shop tools increase productivity, then I’m all for
them. As for this book, it is the best pragmatic application of Lean principles to software I
have ever seen in print. I expected no less from this practical little group of thinking indi-
viduals that has been striving together for years not only to become better, but also to gift
their knowledge to the industry in works such as you now find in your hands. It leaves the
world a little better than I found it before Uncle Bob sent me the manuscript.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Having completed this exercise in lofty insights, I am off to clean my desk.

tough? The answer is: <em>craftsmanship</em>.</p> <p>There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain
the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and
you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and
practicing.</p> <p>I can teach you the physics of riding a bicycle. Indeed, the classical mathematics is
relatively straightforward. Gravity, friction, angular momentum, center of mass, and so
forth, can be demonstrated with less than a page full of equations. Given those formulae I
could prove to you that bicycle riding is practical and give you all the knowledge you
needed to make it work. And you’d still fall down the first time you climbed on that bike.</p> <p>Coding is no different. We could write down all the “feel good” principles of clean
code and then trust you to do the work (in other words, let you fall down when you get on
the bike), but then what kind of teachers would that make us, and what kind of student
would that make you?</p> <p>No. That’s not the way this book is going to work.
Learning to write clean code is <em>hard work</em>. It requires more than just the knowledge of
principles and patterns. You must <em>sweat</em> over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch
yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and
retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for
making those decisions the wrong way.</p> <p>Be prepared to work hard while reading this book. This is not a “feel good” book that
you can read on an airplane and finish before you land. This book will make you work, <em>and
work hard</em>. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code.
And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code and what’s wrong
with it. You’ll be asked to follow along as we take modules apart and put them back
together again. This will take time and effort; but we think it will be worth it.</p> <p>We have divided this book into three parts. The first several chapters describe the prin-
ciples, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. There is quite a bit of code in these
chapters, and they will be challenging to read. They’ll prepare you for the second section
to come. If you put the book down after reading the first section, good luck to you!</p> <p>The second part of the book is the harder work. It consists of several case studies of
ever-increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up some code—of
transforming code that has some problems into code that has fewer problems. The detail in
this section is <em>intense</em>. You will have to flip back and forth between the narrative and the
code listings. You will have to analyze and understand the code we are working with and
walk through our reasoning for making each change we make. Set aside some time
because <em>this should take you days</em>.</p> <p>The third part of this book is the payoff. It is a single chapter containing a list of heu-
ristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. As we walked through and
cleaned up the code in the case studies, we documented every reason for our actions as a</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong> xxvii</p> <p>heuristic or smell. We tried to understand our own reactions to the code we were reading
and changing, and worked hard to capture why we felt what we felt and did what we did.
The result is a knowledge base that desribes the way we think when we write, read, and
clean code.</p> <p>This knowledge base is of limited value if you don’t do the work of carefully reading
through the case studies in the second part of this book. In those case studies we have care-
fully annotated each change we made with forward references to the heuristics. These for-
ward references appear in square brackets like this: [H22]. This lets you see the <em>context</em> in
which those heuristics were applied and written! It is not the heuristics themselves that are
so valuable, it is the <em>relationship between those heuristics and the discrete decisions we
made while cleaning up the code in the case studies</em>.</p> <p>To further help you with those relationships, we have placed a cross-referenceat the end
of the book that shows the page number for every forward reference. You can use it to look
up each place where a certain heuristic was applied.</p> <p>If you read the first and third sections and skip over the case studies, then you will
have read yet another “feel good” book about writing good software. But if you take the
time to work through the case studies, following every tiny step, every minute decision—if
you put yourself in our place, and force yourself to think along the same paths that we
thought, then you will gain a much richer understanding of those principles, patterns, prac-
tices, and heuristics. They won’t be “feel good” knowledge any more. They’ll have been
ground into your gut, fingers, and heart. They’ll have become part of you in the same way
that a bicycle becomes an extension of your will when you have mastered how to ride it.</p> <h3 id="acknowledgments"><a href="#acknowledgments" class="header-anchor">#</a> Acknowledgments</h3> <h4 id="artwork"><a href="#artwork" class="header-anchor">#</a> Artwork</h4> <p>Thank you to my two artists, Jeniffer Kohnke and Angela Brooks.
