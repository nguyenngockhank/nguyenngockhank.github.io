executes in a single thread. It is also easy to write multithreaded code that looks fine on the
surface but is broken at a deeper level. Such code works fine until the system is placed
under stress.</p> <p>In this chapter we discuss the need for concurrent programming, and the difficulties
it presents. We then present several recommendations for dealing with those difficulties,
and writing clean concurrent code. Finally, we conclude with issues related to testing
concurrent code.</p> <p>Clean Concurrency is a complex topic, worthy of a book by itself. Our strategy in <em>this</em>
book is to present an overview here and provide a more detailed tutorial in “Concurrency II”
on page 317. If you are just curious about concurrency, then this chapter will suffice for you
now. If you have a need to understand concurrency at a deeper level, then you should read
through the tutorial as well.</p> <h2 id="why-concurrency"><a href="#why-concurrency" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why Concurrency?</h2> <p>Concurrency is a decoupling strategy. It helps us decouple <em>what</em> gets done from <em>when</em> it
gets done. In single-threaded applications <em>what</em> and <em>when</em> are so strongly coupled that the
state of the entire application can often be determined by looking at the stack backtrace. A
programmer who debugs such a system can set a breakpoint, or a sequence of breakpoints,
and <em>know</em> the state of the system by which breakpoints are hit.</p> <p>Decoupling <em>what</em> from <em>when</em> can dramatically improve both the throughput and struc-
tures of an application. From a structural point of view the application looks like many lit-
tle collaborating computers rather than one big main loop. This can make the system easier
to understand and offers some powerful ways to separate concerns.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the standard “Servlet” model of Web applications. These sys-
tems run under the umbrella of a Web or EJB container that <em>partially</em> manages concur-
rency for you. The servlets are executed asynchronously whenever Web requests come in.
The servlet programmer does not have to manage all the incoming requests. <em>In principle,</em>
each servlet execution lives in its own little world and is decoupled from all the other serv-
let executions.</p> <p>Of course if it were that easy, this chapter wouldn’t be necessary. In fact, the decou-
pling provided by Web containers is far less than perfect. Servlet programmers have to be
very aware, and very careful, to make sure their concurrent programs are correct. Still, the
structural benefits of the servlet model are significant.</p> <p>But structure is not the only motive for adopting concurrency. Some systems have
response time and throughput constraints that require hand-coded concurrent solutions.
For example, consider a single-threaded information aggregator that acquires information
from many different Web sites and merges that information into a daily summary. Because</p> <p><strong>Why Concurrency?</strong> 179</p> <p>this system is single threaded, it hits each Web site in turn, always finishing one before
starting the next. The daily run needs to execute in less than 24 hours. However, as more
and more Web sites are added, the time grows until it takes more than 24 hours to gather
all the data. The single-thread involves a lot of waiting at Web sockets for I/O to complete.
We could improve the performance by using a multithreaded algorithm that hits more than
one Web site at a time.</p> <p>Or consider a system that handles one user at a time and requires only one second
of time per user. This system is fairly responsive for a few users, but as the number of
users increases, the system’s response time increases. No user wants to get in line
behind 150 others! We could improve the response time of this system by handling
many users concurrently.</p> <p>Or consider a system that interprets large data sets but can only give a complete solu-
tion after processing all of them. Perhaps each data set could be processed on a different
computer, so that many data sets are being processed in parallel.</p> <h3 id="myths-and-misconceptions"><a href="#myths-and-misconceptions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Myths and Misconceptions.</h3> <p>And so there are compelling reasons to adopt concurrency. However, as we said before,
concurrency is <em>hard</em>. If you aren’t very careful, you can create some very nasty situations.
Consider these common myths and misconceptions:</p> <ul><li><em>Concurrency always improves performance.</em>
Concurrency can <em>sometimes</em> improve performance, but only when there is a lot of wait
time that can be shared between multiple threads or multiple processors. Neither situ-
ation is trivial.</li> <li><em>Design does not change when writing concurrent programs.</em>
In fact, the design of a concurrent algorithm can be remarkably different from the
design of a single-threaded system. The decoupling of <em>what</em> from <em>when</em> usually has a
huge effect on the structure of the system.</li> <li><em>Understanding concurrency issues is not important when working with a container</em> <em>such as a Web or EJB container.</em>
In fact, you’d better know just what your container is doing and how to guard against
the issues of concurrent update and deadlock described later in this chapter.</li></ul> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Here are a few more balanced sound bites regarding writing concurrent software:

Consider the following trivial class:</p> <p>public class X {
private int lastIdUsed;
public int getNextId() {
return ++lastIdUsed;
}
}
Let’s say we create an instance of X, set the lastIdUsedfield to 42, and then share the
instance between two threads. Now suppose that both of those threads call the method
getNextId(); there are three possible outcomes:</p> <ul><li>Thread one gets the value 43, thread two gets the value 44, lastIdUsed is 44.</li> <li>Thread one gets the value 44, thread two gets the value 43, lastIdUsed is 44.</li> <li>Thread one gets the value 43, thread two gets the value 43, lastIdUsed is 43.</li></ul> <p>The surprising third result^3 occurs when the two threads step on each other. This hap-
pens because there are many possible paths that the two threads can take through that one
line of Java code, and some of those paths generate incorrect results. How many different
paths are there? To really answer that question, we need to understand what the Just-In-
Time Compiler does with the generated byte-code, and understand what the Java memory
model considers to be atomic.</p> <p>A quick answer, working with just the generated byte-code, is that there are 12,870
different possible execution paths^4 for those two threads executing within the getNextId
method. If the type of lastIdUsedis changed from inttolong, the number of possible
paths increases to 2,704,156. Of course most of those paths generate valid results. The
problem is that <em>some of them don’t</em>.</p> <h2 id="concurrency-defense-principles"><a href="#concurrency-defense-principles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Concurrency Defense Principles ..</h2> <p>What follows is a series of principles and techniques for defending your systems from the

and therefore deserves to be separated from the rest of the code. Unfortunately, it is all too
common for concurrency implementation details to be embedded directly into other pro-
duction code. Here are a few things to consider:</p> <ul><li><em>Concurrency-related code has its own life cycle of development,</em> change, and tuning.</li> <li><em>Concurrency-related code has its own challenges,</em> which are different from and often

other, causing unexpected behavior. One solution is to use the synchronizedkeyword to
protect a <em>critical section</em> in the code that uses the shared object. It is important to restrict
the number of such critical sections. The more places shared data can get updated, the
more likely:</p> <ul><li>You will forget to protect one or more of those places—effectively breaking all code
that modifies that shared data.</li> <li>There will be duplication of effort required to make sure everything is effectively
guarded (violation of DRY^7 ).</li> <li>It will be difficult to determine the source of failures, which are already hard enough
to find.</li></ul> <p><strong>Recommendation</strong> : <em>Take data encapsulation to heart; severely limit the access of any
data that may be shared.</em></p> <h3 id="corollary-use-copies-of-data"><a href="#corollary-use-copies-of-data" class="header-anchor">#</a> Corollary: Use Copies of Data ...</h3> <p>A good way to avoid shared data is to avoid sharing the data in the first place. In some sit-
uations it is possible to copy objects and treat them as read-only. In other cases it might be
possible to copy objects, collect results from multiple threads in these copies and then
merge the results in a single thread.</p> <ol start="5"><li>[PPP]</li> <li>See “Client/Server Example” on page 317.</li> <li>[PRAG].</li></ol> <p>182 <strong>Chapter 13: Concurrency</strong></p> <p>If there is an easy way to avoid sharing objects, the resulting code will be far less likely
to cause problems. You might be concerned about the cost of all the extra object creation. It is
worth experimenting to find out if this is in fact a problem. However, if using copies of
objects allows the code to avoid synchronizing, the savings in avoiding the intrinsic lock will
likely make up for the additional creation and garbage collection overhead.</p> <h3 id="corollary-threads-should-be-as-independent-as-possible"><a href="#corollary-threads-should-be-as-independent-as-possible" class="header-anchor">#</a> Corollary: Threads Should Be as Independent as Possible</h3> <p>Consider writing your threaded code such that each thread exists in its own world, sharing
no data with any other thread. Each thread processes one client request, with all of its
required data coming from an unshared source and stored as local variables. This makes
each of those threads behave as if it were the only thread in the world and there were no
synchronization requirements.</p> <p>For example, classes that subclass from HttpServletreceive all of their information
as parameters passed in to the doGetanddoPostmethods. This makes each Servletact
as if it has its own machine. So long as the code in the Servletuses only local variables,
there is no chance that the Servletwill cause synchronization problems. Of course,
most applications using Servletseventually run into shared resources such as database
connections.</p> <p><strong>Recommendation</strong> : <em>Attempt to partition data into independent subsets than can be
operated on by independent threads, possibly in different processors.</em></p> <h2 id="know-your-library"><a href="#know-your-library" class="header-anchor">#</a> Know Your Library ...</h2> <p>Java 5 offers many improvements for concurrent development over previous versions. There

more consumer threads acquire that work from the queue and complete it. The queue
between the producers and consumers is a <em>bound resource</em>. This means producers must
wait for free space in the queue before writing and consumers must wait until there is
something in the queue to consume. Coordination between the producers and consumers
via the queue involves producers and consumers signaling each other. The producers write
to the queue and signal that the queue is no longer empty. Consumers read from the queue
and signal that the queue is no longer full. Both potentially wait to be notified when they
can continue.</p> <h3 id="readers-writers-10"><a href="#readers-writers-10" class="header-anchor">#</a> Readers-Writers^10</h3> <p>When you have a shared resource that primarily serves as a source of information for read-
ers, but which is occasionally updated by writers, throughput is an issue. Emphasizing
throughput can cause starvation and the accumulation of stale information. Allowing
updates can impact throughput. Coordinating readers so they do not read something a
writer is updating and vice versa is a tough balancing act. Writers tend to block many read-
ers for a long period of time, thus causing throughput issues.</p> <p>The challenge is to balance the needs of both readers and writers to satisfy correct
operation, provide reasonable throughput and avoiding starvation. A simple strategy
makes writers wait until there are no readers before allowing the writer to perform an
update. If there are continuous readers, however, the writers will be starved. On the other
hand, if there are frequent writers and they are given priority, throughput will suffer. Find-
ing that balance and avoiding concurrent update issues is what the problem addresses.</p> <h3 id="dining-philosophers-11"><a href="#dining-philosophers-11" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dining Philosophers^11</h3> <p>Imagine a number of philosophers sitting around a circular table. A fork is placed to the
left of each philosopher. There is a big bowl of spaghetti in the center of the table. The
philosophers spend their time thinking unless they get hungry. Once hungry, they pick
up the forks on either side of them and eat. A philosopher cannot eat unless he is holding
two forks. If the philosopher to his right or left is already using one of the forks he
needs, he must wait until that philosopher finishes eating and puts the forks back down.
Once a philosopher eats, he puts both his forks back down on the table and waits until he
is hungry again.</p> <p>Replace philosophers with threads and forks with resources and this problem is simi-

ever, if there is more than one synchronized method on the same shared class, then your
system may be written incorrectly.^12</p> <p><strong>Recommendation</strong> : <em>Avoid using more than one method on a shared object.</em>
There will be times when you must use more than one method on a shared object.
When this is the case, there are three ways to make the code correct:</p> <ul><li><strong>Client-Based Locking</strong> —Have the client lock the server before calling the first
method and make sure the lock’s extent includes code calling the last method.</li> <li><strong>Server-Based Locking</strong> —Within the server create a method that locks the server, calls
all the methods, and then unlocks. Have the client call the new method.</li> <li><strong>Adapted Server</strong> —create an intermediary that performs the locking. This is an exam-
ple of server-based locking, where the original server cannot be changed.</li></ul> <h2 id="keep-synchronized-sections-small"><a href="#keep-synchronized-sections-small" class="header-anchor">#</a> Keep Synchronized Sections Small ..</h2> <p>Thesynchronizedkeyword introduces a lock. All sections of code guarded by the
same lock are guaranteed to have only one thread executing through them at any given
time. Locks are expensive because they create delays and add overhead. So we don’t
want to litter our code with synchronizedstatements. On the other hand, critical sec-
tions^13 must be guarded. So we want to design our code with as few critical sections as
possible.</p> <p>Some naive programmers try to achieve this by making their critical sections very
large. However, extending synchronization beyond the minimal critical section increases

with threads waiting for a signal to continue that never comes.</p> <p>For example, imagine a system with a parent thread that spawns several child threads
and then waits for them all to finish before it releases its resources and shuts down. What if
one of the spawned threads is deadlocked? The parent will wait forever, and the system
will never shut down.</p> <p>Or consider a similar system that has been <em>instructed</em> to shut down. The parent tells all
the spawned children to abandon their tasks and finish. But what if two of the children
were operating as a producer/consumer pair. Suppose the producer receives the signal
from the parent and quickly shuts down. The consumer might have been expecting a mes-
sage from the producer and be blocked in a state where it cannot receive the shutdown sig-
nal. It could get stuck waiting for the producer and never finish, preventing the parent from
finishing as well.</p> <p>Situations like this are not at all uncommon. So if you must write concurrent code that

that different operating systems have different threading policies, each of which impacts
the code’s execution. Multithreaded code behaves differently in different environments.^16
You should run your tests in every potential deployment environment.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Recommendation : Run your threaded code on all target platforms early and often.

Simple tests often don’t expose them.
Indeed, they often hide during normal processing. They might show up once every few
hours, or days, or weeks!</p> <p>The reason that threading bugs can be infrequent, sporadic, and hard to repeat, is that
only a very few pathways out of the many thousands of possible pathways through a vul-
nerable section actually fail. So the probability that a failing pathway is taken can be star-
tlingly low. This makes detection and debugging very difficult.</p> <p>How might you increase your chances of catching such rare occurrences? You can
instrument your code and force it to run in different orderings by adding calls to methods
like Object.wait(),Object.sleep(),Object.yield() and Object.priority().</p> <p>Each of these methods can affect the order of execution, thereby increasing the odds
of detecting a flaw. It’s better when broken code fails as early and as often as possible.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>There are two options for code instrumentation:
</code></pre></div><ul><li>Hand-coded</li> <li>Automated</li></ul> <ol start="16"><li>Did you know that the threading model in Java does not guarantee preemptive threading? Modern OS’s support preemptive
threading, so you get that “for free.” Even so, it not guaranteed by the JVM.</li></ol> <p><strong>Testing Threaded Code</strong> 189</p> <h3 id="hand-coded"><a href="#hand-coded" class="header-anchor">#</a> Hand-Coded ...</h3> <p>You can insert calls to wait(),sleep(),yield(), and priority()in your code by hand. It
might be just the thing to do when you’re testing a particularly thorny piece of code.</p> <p>Here is an example of doing just that:
public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {
if(hasNext()) {
String url = urlGenerator.next();
Thread.yield(); // inserted for testing.
updateHasNext();
return url;
}
return null;
}
The inserted call to yield()will change the execution pathways taken by the code and
possibly cause the code to fail where it did not fail before. If the code does break, it was
not because you added a call to yield().^17 Rather, your code was broken and this simply
made the failure evident.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>There are many problems with this approach:
</code></pre></div><ul><li>You have to manually find appropriate places to do this.</li> <li>How do you know where to put the call and what kind of call to use?</li> <li>Leaving such code in a production environment unnecessarily slows the code down.</li> <li>It’s a shotgun approach. You may or may not find flaws. Indeed, the odds aren’t with you.</li></ul> <p>What we need is a way to do this during testing but not in production. We also need to
easily mix up configurations between different runs, which results in increased chances of
finding errors in the aggregate.</p> <p>Clearly, if we divide our system up into POJOs that know nothing of threading and
classes that control the threading, it will be easier to find appropriate places to instrument
the code. Moreover, we could create many different test jigs that invoke the POJOs under
different regimes of calls to sleep,yield, and so on.</p> <h3 id="automated"><a href="#automated" class="header-anchor">#</a> Automated ..</h3> <p>You could use tools like an Aspect-Oriented Framework, CGLIB, or ASM to programmat-
ically instrument your code. For example, you could use a class with a single method:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public class ThreadJigglePoint {
public static void jiggle() {
}
}
</code></pre></div><ol start="17"><li>This is not strictly the case. Since the JVM does not guarantee preemptive threading, a particular algorithm might always
work on an OS that does not preempt threads. The reverse is also possible but for different reasons.</li></ol> <p>190 <strong>Chapter 13: Concurrency</strong></p> <p>You can add calls to this in various places within your code:
public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {
if(hasNext()) {
ThreadJiglePoint.jiggle();
String url = urlGenerator.next();
ThreadJiglePoint.jiggle();
updateHasNext();
ThreadJiglePoint.jiggle();
return url;
}
return null;
}
Now you use a simple aspect that randomly selects among doing nothing, sleeping, or
yielding.</p> <p>Or imagine that the ThreadJigglePointclass has two implementations. The first imple-
mentsjiggleto do nothing and is used in production. The second generates a random
number to choose between sleeping, yielding, or just falling through. If you run your tests
a thousand times with random jiggling, you may root out some flaws. If the tests pass, at
least you can say you’ve done due diligence. Though a bit simplistic, this could be a rea-
sonable option in lieu of a more sophisticated tool.</p> <p>There is a tool called ConTest,^18 developed by IBM that does something similar, but it
does so with quite a bit more sophistication.</p> <p>The point is to jiggle the code so that threads run in different orderings at different
times. The combination of well-written tests and jiggling can dramatically increase the
chance finding errors.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>Recommendation : Use jiggling strategies to ferret out errors.

marish when multiple threads and shared data get into the mix. If you are faced with writ-
ing concurrent code, you need to write clean code with rigor or else face subtle and
infrequent failures.</p> <p>First and foremost, follow the Single Responsibility Principle. Break your system into
POJOs that separate thread-aware code from thread-ignorant code. Make sure when you
are testing your thread-aware code, you are only testing it and nothing else. This suggests
that your thread-aware code should be small and focused.</p> <p>Know the possible sources of concurrency issues: multiple threads operating on
shared data, or using a common resource pool. Boundary cases, such as shutting down
cleanly or finishing the iteration of a loop, can be especially thorny.</p> <ol start="18"><li><a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/contest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/contest<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></li></ol> <p><strong>Bibliography</strong> 191</p> <p>Learn your library and know the fundamental algorithms.

regions of code that do not need to be locked. Avoid calling one locked section from
another. This requires a deep understanding of whether something is or is not shared. Keep
the amount of shared objects and the scope of the sharing as narrow as possible. Change
designs of the objects with shared data to accommodate clients rather than forcing clients
to manage shared state.</p> <p>Issues will crop up. The ones that do not crop up early are often written off as a one-
time occurrence. These so-called one-offs typically only happen under load or at seem-
ingly random times. Therefore, you need to be able to run your thread-related code in
many configurations on many platforms repeatedly and continuously. Testability, which
comes naturally from following the Three Laws of TDD, implies some level of plug-ability,
which offers the support necessary to run code in a wider range of configurations.</p> <p>You will greatly improve your chances of finding erroneous code if you take the time
to instrument your code. You can either do so by hand or using some kind of automated
technology. Invest in this early. You want to be running your thread-based code as long as
possible before you put it into production.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>If you take a clean approach, your chances of getting it right increase drastically.
