Deep within that library there is a package named org.jfree.date. Within that package
there is a class named SerialDate. We are going to explore that class.</p> <p>The author of SerialDateis David Gilbert. David is clearly an experienced and com-
petent programmer. As we shall see, he shows a significant degree of professionalism and
discipline within his code. For all intents and purposes, this is “good code.” And I am
going to rip it to pieces.</p> <p>268 <strong>Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</strong></p> <p>This is not an activity of malice. Nor do I think that I am so much better than David
that I somehow have a right to pass judgment on his code. Indeed, if you were to find some
of my code, I’m sure you could find plenty of things to complain about.</p> <p>No, this is not an activity of nastiness or arrogance. What I am about to do is nothing
more and nothing less than a professional review. It is something that we should all be
comfortable doing. And it is something we should welcome when it is done for us. It is
only through critiques like these that we will learn. Doctors do it. Pilots do it. Lawyers do
it. And we programmers need to learn how to do it too.</p> <p>One more thing about David Gilbert: David is more than just a good programmer.
David had the courage and good will to offer his code to the community at large for free.
He placed it out in the open for all to see and invited public usage and public scrutiny. This
was well done!</p> <p>SerialDate(Listing B-1, page 349) is a class that represents a date in Java. Why have
a class that represents a date, when Java already has java.util.Date and
java.util.Calendar, and others? The author wrote this class in response to a pain that I
have often felt myself. The comment in his opening Javadoc (line 67) explains it well. We
could quibble about his intention, but I have certainly had to deal with this issue, and I
welcome a class that is about dates instead of times.</p> <h2 id="first-make-it-work"><a href="#first-make-it-work" class="header-anchor">#</a> First, Make It Work ...</h2> <p>There are some unit tests in a class named SerialDateTests(Listing B-2, page 366). The
tests all pass. Unfortunately a quick inspection of the tests shows that they don’t test every-
thing [T1]. For example, doing a “Find Usages” search on the method MonthCodeToQuarter
(line 334) indicates that it is not used [F4]. Therefore, the unit tests don’t test it.</p> <p>So I fired up Clover to see what the unit tests covered and what they didn’t. Clover
reported that the unit tests executed only 91 of the 185 executable statements in SerialDate
(~50 percent) [T2]. The coverage map looks like a patchwork quilt, with big gobs of unex-
ecuted code littered all through the class.</p> <p>It was my goal to completely understand and also refactor this class. I couldn’t do that
without much greater test coverage. So I wrote my own suite of completely independent
unit tests (Listing B-4, page 374).</p> <p>As you look through these tests, you will note that many of them are commented out.
These tests didn’t pass. They represent behavior that I think SerialDate should have. So as
I refactor SerialDate, I’ll be working to make these tests pass too.</p> <p>Even with some of the tests commented out, Clover reports that the new unit tests are
executing 170 (92 percent) out of the 185 executable statements. This is pretty good, and I
think we’ll be able to get this number higher.</p> <p>The first few commented-out tests (lines 23-63) were a bit of conceit on my part. The
program was not designed to pass these tests, but the behavior seemed obvious [G2] to me.</p> <p><strong>First, Make It Work</strong> 269</p> <p>I’m not sure why the testWeekdayCodeToStringmethod was written in the first place, but
because it is there, it seems obvious that it should not be case sensitive. Writing these tests
was trivial [T3]. Making them pass was even easier; I just changed lines 259 and 263 to
useequalsIgnoreCase.</p> <p>I left the tests at line 32 and line 45 commented out because it’s not clear to me that
the “tues” and “thurs” abbreviations ought to be supported.</p> <p>The tests on line 153 and line 154 don’t pass. Clearly, they should [G2]. We can easily
fix this, and the tests on line 163 through line 213, by making the following changes to the
stringToMonthCode function.</p> <p>The commented test on line 318 exposes a bug in the getFollowingDayOfWeekmethod
(line 672). December 25th, 2004, was a Saturday. The following Saturday was January 1st,</p> <ol start="2005"><li>However, when we run the test, we see that getFollowingDayOfWeekreturns Decem-
ber 25th as the Saturday that follows December 25th. Clearly, this is wrong [G3],[T1]. We
see the problem in line 685. It is a typical boundary condition error [T5]. It should read as
follows:</li></ol> <p>It is interesting to note that this function was the target of an earlier repair. The change
history (line 43) shows that “bugs” were fixed in getPreviousDayOfWeek,getFollowing-
DayOfWeek, and getNearestDayOfWeek [T6].</p> <p>ThetestGetNearestDayOfWeek unit test (line 329), which tests the getNearestDayOfWeek
method (line 705), did not start out as long and exhaustive as it currently is. I added a lot
of test cases to it because my initial test cases did not all pass [T6]. You can see the pattern
of failure by looking at which test cases are commented out. That pattern is revealing [T7].
It shows that the algorithm fails if the nearest day is in the future. Clearly there is some
kind of boundary condition error [T5].</p> <p>The pattern of test coverage reported by Clover is also interesting [T8]. Line 719
never gets executed! This means that the ifstatement in line 718 is always false. Sure
enough, a look at the code shows that this must be true. The adjust variable is always neg-
ative and so cannot be greater or equal to 4. So this algorithm is just wrong.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>457 if ((result &lt; 1) || (result &gt; 12)) {

it’s time to make it “right.”</p> <h2 id="then-make-it-right"><a href="#then-make-it-right" class="header-anchor">#</a> Then Make It Right ...</h2> <p>We are going to walk from the top to the bottom of SerialDate, improving it as we go
along. Although you won’t see this in the discussion, I will be running all of the JCommon
unit tests, including my improved unit test for SerialDate, after every change I make. So
rest assured that every change you see here works for all of JCommon.</p> <p>Starting at line 1, we see a ream of comments with license information, copyrights,
authors, and change history. I acknowledge that there are certain legalities that need to be
addressed, and so the copyrights and licenses must stay. On the other hand, the change his-
tory is a leftover from the 1960s. We have source code control tools that do this for us now.
This history should be deleted [C1].</p> <p>The import list starting at line 61 could be shortened by using java.text.<em>and
java.util.</em>. [J1]</p> <p>I wince at the HTML formatting in the Javadoc (line 67). Having a source file with
more than one language in it troubles me. This comment has <em>four</em> languages in it: Java,
English, Javadoc, and html [G1]. With that many languages in use, it’s hard to keep things
straight. For example, the nice positioning of line 71 and line 72 are lost when the Javadoc
is generated, and yet who wants to see <em>ul</em> and <em>li</em> in the source code? A better strategy
might be to just surround the whole comment with <em>pre</em> so that the formatting that is

same in both code and document.</li></ol> <p><strong>Then Make It Right</strong> 271</p> <p>I won’t keep you guessing. I know why (or at least I think I know why) the word
“serial” was used. The clue is in the constants SERIAL_LOWER_BOUND and
SERIAL_UPPER_BOUND on line 98 and line 101. An even better clue is in the comment
that begins on line 830. This class is named SerialDatebecause it is implemented using a
“serial number,” which happens to be the number of days since December 30th, 1899.</p> <p>I have two problems with this. First, the term “serial number” is not really correct.
This may be a quibble, but the representation is more of a relative offset than a serial num-
ber. The term “serial number” has more to do with product identification markers than
dates. So I don’t find this name particularly descriptive [N1]. A more descriptive term
might be “ordinal.”</p> <p>The second problem is more significant. The name SerialDateimplies an implementa-
tion. This class is an abstract class. There is no need to imply anything at all about the
implementation. Indeed, there is good reason to hide the implementation! So I find this
name to be at the wrong level of abstraction [N2]. In my opinion, the name of this class
should simply be Date.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are already too many classes in the Java library named Date, so
this is probably not the best name to choose. Because this class is all about days, instead of
time, I considered naming it Day, but this name is also heavily used in other places. In the
end, I chose DayDate as the best compromise.</p> <p>From now on in this discussion I will use the term DayDate. I leave it to you to remem-
ber that the listings you are looking at still use SerialDate.</p> <p>I understand why DayDateinherits from ComparableandSerializable. But why does it
inherit from MonthConstants? The class MonthConstants(Listing B-3, page 372) is just a
bunch of static final constants that define the months. Inheriting from classes with con-
stants is an old trick that Java programmers used so that they could avoid using expres-
sions like MonthConstants.January, but it’s a bad idea [J2]. MonthConstants should really be
an enum.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public abstract class DayDate implements Comparable,

and all it’s users. It took me an hour to make all the changes. However, any function that
used to take an intfor a month, now takes a Monthenumerator. This means we can get rid
of the isValidMonthCodemethod (line 326), and all the month code error checking such as
that in monthCodeToQuarter (line 356) [G5].</p> <p>Next, we have line 91, serialVersionUID. This variable is used to control the serializer.
If we change it, then any DayDatewritten with an older version of the software won’t be
readable anymore and will result in an InvalidClassException. If you don’t declare the
serialVersionUIDvariable, then the compiler automatically generates one for you, and it
will be different every time you make a change to the module. I know that all the docu-
ments recommend manual control of this variable, but it seems to me that automatic con-
trol of serialization is a lot safer [G4]. After all, I’d much rather debug an
InvalidClassExceptionthan the odd behavior that would ensue if I forgot to change the
serialVersionUID. So I’m going to delete the variable—at least for the time being.^2</p> <p>I find the comment on line 93 redundant. Redundant comments are just places to col-
lect lies and misinformation [C2]. So I’m going to get rid of it and its ilk.</p> <p>The comments at line 97 and line 100 talk about serial numbers, which I discussed
earlier [C1]. The variables they describe are the earliest and latest possible dates that
DayDate can describe. This can be made a bit clearer [N1].</p> <p>It’s not clear to me why EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINALis 2 instead of 0. There is a hint in the
comment on line 829 that suggests that this has something to do with the way dates are
represented in Microsoft Excel. There is a much deeper insight provided in a derivative of
DayDatecalledSpreadsheetDate(Listing B-5, page 382). The comment on line 71 describes
the issue nicely.</p> <p>The problem I have with this is that the issue seems to be related to the implementa-
tion of SpreadsheetDateand has nothing to do with DayDate. I conclude from this that</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public static Month make(int monthIndex) {

}
public final int index;
}
</code></pre></div><ol start="2"><li>Several of the reviewers of this text have taken exception to this decision. They contend that in an open source framework itis
better to assert manual control over the serial ID so that minor changes to the software don’t cause old serialized dates to be
invalid. This is a fair point. However, at least the failure, inconvenient though it might be, has a clear-cut cause. On the other
hand, if the author of the class forgets to update the ID, then the failure mode is undefined and might very well be silent. I
think the real moral of this story is that you should not expect to deserialize across versions.</li></ol> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public static final int EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINAL = 2; // 1/1/1900

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Then Make It Right</strong> 273</p> <p>EARLIEST_DATE_ORDINALand LATEST_DATE_ORDINALdo not really belong in DayDateand
should be moved to SpreadsheetDate[G6].</p> <p>Indeed, a search of the code shows that these variables are used only within
SpreadsheetDate. Nothing in DayDate, nor in any other class in the JCommonframework, uses
them. Therefore, I’ll move them down into SpreadsheetDate.</p> <p>The next variables, MINIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED, and MAXIMUM_YEAR_SUPPORTED(line 104
and line 107), provide something of a dilemma. It seems clear that if DayDate is an abstract
class that provides no foreshadowing of implementation, then it should not inform us
about a minimum or maximum year. Again, I am tempted to move these variables down
intoSpreadsheetDate[G6]. However, a quick search of the users of these variables shows
that one other class uses them: RelativeDayOfWeekRule(Listing B-6, page 390). We see that
usage at line 177 and line 178 in the getDatefunction, where they are used to check that
the argument to getDateis a valid year. The dilemma is that a user of an abstract class
needs information about its implementation.</p> <p>What we need to do is provide this information without polluting DayDateitself.
Usually, we would get implementation information from an instance of a derivative.
However, the getDatefunction is not passed an instance of a DayDate. It does, however,
return such an instance, which means that somewhere it must be creating it. Line 187
through line 205 provide the hint. The DayDateinstance is being created by one of the
three functions, getPreviousDayOfWeek,getNearestDayOfWeek, or getFollowingDayOfWeek.
Looking back at the DayDatelisting, we see that these functions (lines 638–724) all return
a date created by addDays(line 571), which calls createInstance(line 808), which creates
aSpreadsheetDate! [G7].</p> <p>It’s generally a bad idea for base classes to know about their derivatives. To fix this, we
should use the ABSTRACT FACTORY^3 pattern and create a DayDateFactory. This factory will
create the instances of DayDatethat we need and can also answer questions about the
implementation, such as the maximum and minimum dates.</p> <ol start="3"><li>[GOF].</li></ol> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public abstract class DayDateFactory {

really be another enum [J3]. We’ve seen this pattern before, so I won’t repeat it here. You’ll
see it in the final listings.</p> <p>Next, we see a series of tables starting with LAST_DAY_OF_MONTHat line 140. My first
issue with these tables is that the comments that describe them are redundant [C3]. Their
names are sufficient. So I’m going to delete the comments.</p> <p>There seems to be no good reason that this table isn’t private [G8], because there is a
static function lastDayOfMonth that provides the same data.</p> <p>The next table, AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_MONTH, is a bit more mysterious because it is
not used anywhere in the JCommon framework [G9]. So I deleted it.</p> <p>The same goes for LEAP_YEAR_AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_MONTH.
The next table, AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_PRECEDING_MONTH, is used only in Spread-
sheetDate(line 434 and line 473). This begs the question of whether it should be moved
toSpreadsheetDate. The argument for not moving it is that the table is not specific to any
particular implementation [G6]. On the other hand, no implementation other than
SpreadsheetDateactually exists, and so the table should be moved close to where it is
used [G10].</p> <p>What settles the argument for me is that to be consistent [G11], we should make the
table private and expose it through a function like julianDateOfLastDayOfMonth. Nobody
seems to need a function like that. Moreover, the table can be moved back to DayDateeasily
if any new implementation of DayDate needs it. So I moved it.</p> <p>The same goes for the table, LEAP_YEAR_AGGREGATE_DAYS_TO_END_OF_MONTH.
Next, we see three sets of constants that can be turned into enums (lines 162–205).
The first of the three selects a week within a month. I changed it into an enum named
WeekInMonth.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>protected int _getMinimumYear() {

</code></pre></div><p>276 <strong>Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</strong></p> <p>The second set of constants (lines 177–187) is a bit more obscure. The INCLUDE_NONE,
INCLUDE_FIRST,INCLUDE_SECOND, and INCLUDE_BOTHconstants are used to describe whether
the defining end-point dates of a range should be included in that range. Mathematically,
this is described using the terms “open interval,” “half-open interval,” and “closed inter-
val.” I think it is clearer using the mathematical nomenclature [N3], so I changed it to an
enum named DateInterval with CLOSED,CLOSED_LEFT,CLOSED_RIGHT, and OPEN enumerators.</p> <p>The third set of constants (lines 18–205) describe whether a search for a particular
day of the week should result in the last, next, or nearest instance. Deciding what to call
this is difficult at best. In the end, I settled for WeekdayRangewithLAST,NEXT, and NEAREST
enumerators.</p> <p>You might not agree with the names I’ve chosen. They make sense to me, but they
may not make sense to you. The point is that they are now in a form that makes them easy
to change [J3]. They aren’t passed as integers anymore; they are passed as symbols. I can
use the “change name” function of my IDE to change the names, or the types, without
worrying that I missed some -1or 2 somewhere in the code or that some intargument dec-
laration is left poorly described.</p> <p>The description field at line 208 does not seem to be used by anyone. I deleted it along
with its accessor and mutator [G9].</p> <p>I also deleted the degenerate default constructor at line 213 [G12]. The compiler will
generate it for us.</p> <p>We can skip over the isValidWeekdayCodemethod (lines 216–238) because we deleted
it when we created the Day enumeration.</p> <p>This brings us to the stringToWeekdayCodemethod (lines 242–270). Javadocs that
don’t add much to the method signature are just clutter [C3],[G12]. The only value this
Javadoc adds is the description of the -1return value. However, because we changed to the
Dayenumeration, the comment is actually wrong [C2]. The method now throws an
IllegalArgumentException. So I deleted the Javadoc.</p> <p>I also deleted all the final keywords in arguments and variable declarations. As far as
I could tell, they added no real value but did add to the clutter [G12]. Eliminating final
flies in the face of some conventional wisdom. For example, Robert Simmons^6 strongly
recommends us to “... spread finalall over your code.” Clearly I disagree. I think that
there are a few good uses for final, such as the occasional finalconstant, but otherwise
the keyword adds little value and creates a lot of clutter. Perhaps I feel this way because the
kinds of errors that final might catch are already caught by the unit tests I write.</p> <p>I didn’t care for the duplicate ifstatements [G5] inside the forloop (line 259 and
line 263), so I connected them into a single ifstatement using the ||operator. I also used
theDay enumeration to direct the for loop and made a few other cosmetic changes.</p> <p>It occurred to me that this method does not really belong in DayDate. It’s really the
parse function of Day. So I moved it into the Dayenumeration. However, that made the Day</p> <ol start="6"><li>[Simmons04], p. 73.</li></ol> <p><strong>Then Make It Right</strong> 277</p> <p>enumeration pretty large. Because the concept of Daydoes not depend on DayDate, I moved
theDay enumeration outside of the DayDate class into its own source file [G13].</p> <p>I also moved the next function, weekdayCodeToString(lines 272–286) into the Day
enumeration and called it toString.</p> <p>There are two getMonthsfunctions (lines 288–316). The first calls the second. The
second is never called by anyone but the first. Therefore, I collapsed the two into one and
vastly simplified them [G9],[G12],[F4]. Finally, I changed the name to be a bit more self-
descriptive [N1].</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public enum Day {

nobody other than the tests called relativeToString(lines 765–781), I simply deleted the
function and its tests.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>offsetToTarget += 7;

is as appropriate as they come: toSerial(lines 838–844). Back on page 279 I had changed
the name to toOrdinal. Having looked at it in this context, I decided the name should be
changed to getOrdinalDay.</p> <p>The next abstract method is toDate(lines 838–844). It converts a DayDate to a
java.util.Date. Why is this method abstract? If we look at its implementation in
SpreadsheetDate(lines 198–207, Listing B-5, page 382), we see that it doesn’t depend on
anything in the implementation of that class [G6]. So I pushed it up.</p> <p>ThegetYYYY,getMonth, and getDayOfMonthmethods are nicely abstract. However, the
getDayOfWeekmethod is another one that should be pulled up from SpreadSheetDate
because it doesn’t depend on anything that can’t be found in DayDate[G6]. Or does it?</p> <p>If you look carefully (line 247, Listing B-5, page 382), you’ll see that the algorithm
implicitly depends on the origin of the ordinal day (in other words, the day of the week of
day 0). So even though this function has no physical dependencies that couldn’t be moved
toDayDate, it does have a logical dependency.</p> <p>Logical dependencies like this bother me [G22]. If something logical depends on
the implementation, then something physical should too. Also, it seems to me that the
algorithm itself could be generic with a much smaller portion of it dependent on the
implementation[G6].</p> <p>So I created an abstract method in DayDatenamedgetDayOfWeekForOrdinalZeroand
implemented it in SpreadsheetDateto return Day.SATURDAY. Then I moved the getDayOfWeek
method up to DayDateand changed it to call getOrdinalDayandgetDayOfWeekForOrdinal-
Zero.</p> <p>As a side note, look carefully at the comment on line 895 through line 899. Was this
repetition really necessary? As usual, I deleted this comment along with all the others.</p> <p>The next method is compare(lines 902–913). Again, this method is inappropriately
abstract [G6], so I pulled the implementation up into DayDate. Also, the name does not
communicate enough [N1]. This method actually returns the difference in days since the
argument. So I changed the name to daysSince. Also, I noted that there weren’t any tests
for this method, so I wrote them.</p> <p>The next six functions (lines 915–980) are all abstract methods that should be imple-
mented in DayDate. So I pulled them all up from SpreadsheetDate.</p> <p>The last function, isInRange(lines 9 8 2–995) also needs to be pulled up and refac-
tored. The switchstatement is a bit ugly [G23]and can be replaced by moving the cases
into the DateInterval enum.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public Day getDayOfWeek() {
Day startingDay = getDayOfWeekForOrdinalZero();
int startingOffset = startingDay.index - Day.SUNDAY.index;
return Day.make((getOrdinalDay() + startingOffset) % 7 + 1);
}
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Then Make It Right</strong> 283</p> <p>That brings us to the end of DayDate. So now we’ll make one more pass over the whole
class to see how well it flows.</p> <p>First, the opening comment is long out of date, so I shortened and improved it [C2].
Next, I moved all the remaining enums out into their own files [G12].
Next, I moved the static variable (dateFormatSymbols) and three static methods
(getMonthNames <em>,</em> isLeapYear <em>,</em> lastDayOfMonth) into a new class named DateUtil[G6].</p> <p>I moved the abstract methods up to the top where they belong[G24].
I changed Month.make to Month.fromInt[N1] and did the same for all the other enums.
I also created a toInt() accessor for all the enums and made the index field private.</p> <p>There was some interesting duplication [G5] in plusYearsandplusMonthsthat I was
able to eliminate by extracting a new method named correctLastDayOfMonth, making the
all three methods much clearer.</p> <p>I got rid of the magic number 1 [G25],replacing it with Month.JANUARY.toInt()or
Day.SUNDAY.toInt(), as appropriate. I spent a little time with SpreadsheetDate, cleaning up
the algorithms a bit. The end result is contained in Listing B-7, page 394, through
Listing B-16, page 405.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>public enum DateInterval {

return interval.isIn(getOrdinalDay(), left, right);
}
</code></pre></div><p>284 <strong>Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate</strong></p> <p>Interestingly the code coverage in DayDatehas <em>decreased</em> to 84.9 percent! This is not
because less functionality is being tested; rather it is because the class has shrunk so much
that the few uncovered lines have a greater weight. DayDatenow has 45 out of 53 execut-
able statements covered by tests. The uncovered lines are so trivial that they weren’t worth
testing.</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conclusion ..</h2> <p>So once again we’ve followed the Boy Scout Rule. We’ve checked the code in a bit cleaner
than when we checked it out. It took a little time, but it was worth it. Test coverage was
increased, some bugs were fixed, the code was clarified and shrunk. The next person to
look at this code will hopefully find it easier to deal with than we did. That person will also
probably be able to clean it up a bit more than we did.</p> <h2 id="bibliography"><a href="#bibliography" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bibliography ...</h2> <p><strong>[GOF]:</strong> <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software</em> , Gamma et al.,
